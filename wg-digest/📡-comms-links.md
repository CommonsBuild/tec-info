  > Hey @blazingthirdeye I agree! 1. That’s an immense amount of pressure. and 2. I’m a bit surprised to hear that; I assumed the Comms WG were stewarding this as a group. Could share a little more about the current responsibilities and roles as they fall? Sounds like you’re stewarding Twitter alone? Absolutely. I wonder if this is a good opportunity to: Put the call out for a small team to work with you for a specified period of time to dive into these questions and bring your shared findings...

Disputable means that proposals can be challanged meanwhile they are voted. When a challenging happens, an Arbitrator decides if the proposal should be canceled or if it should continue according to what the TEC Community Covenant says. This will convert TEC into a manifesto-based organization. This means we need to...

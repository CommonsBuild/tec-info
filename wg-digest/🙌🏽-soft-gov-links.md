  > Organizational partnership refers to the collaboration between two or more organizations with common goals that commit to work together and share resources. By working together, the partners are able to capitalize on their respective strengths in order to achieve a more positive outcome than if each organization had worked individually. Relationships between individuals are addressed in the Social Interaction section. Forming an organizational partnership can be either optional, by volunteering time as in-kind contribution, or mandated by a contractual requirement to work with a specific number of organizations. Within the context of knowledge management (KM), building successful partnerships can help organizations learn from each other‚Äôs experiences and expertise, work more effectively with stakeholders and other collaborators, and improve health outcomes, as a result of a shared goal/vision. Many global health advances have been achieved as a result of the creation of strategic partnerships, such as Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance; Family Planning 2020 (FP2020); and the Roll Back Malaria Partnership, to name a few. KM within organizational partnerships also includes capacity strengthening and support across organizations and within an organization to adopt KM practices.

- [Token Exchange Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00746)
  > Human societies engage in a number of games which use tokens as a means to allocate, issue and access gated resources and property rights: The notion of exchanging tokens that represent and carry value from the past into the future to facilitate economic exchange is a fundamental concept. As agents exchange tokens a network structure is created in which the tokens move from agent to agent. Agents form the vertices in the network and the exchange of tokens creates the link structure. The rules of exchange adopted collectively by agents shape the network structure and affect the distribution of tokens amongst agents. Many inventions including banking, payments networks and blockchain technology have been created for the purpose of keeping accurate records of these implicit networks. However, our formal understanding of tokenised systems as large scale, iterative, interacting structures is limited. The aim of this paper is to study the dynamics of token exchanges as a game, and introduce a mathematical framework for understanding ledgers as complex networks.

  > Peer-to-peer networks and protocols have inspired new ideas and ideologies about governance, with the aim of using technology to enable horizontal and decentralized decision-making at scale. This article introduces the concept of ‚Äúdissensus‚Äù from political theory to debates about peer governance in online communities. Dissensus describes the emergence of incompatible differences. Among peer-to-peer technologies, blockchain stands out as a set of ideas that explicitly seek to resolve dissensus through consensus protocols. In this article, we propose dissensus as a ‚Äúprotocol‚Äù for foregrounding the often sidelined yet productive aspects of incompatible differences. The concept highlights that there might not always be consensus about a consensus algorithm, and that indeed, dissensus is the precondition for new possibilities and perspectives to emerge. We discuss the concept in relation to the histories of governance ideas in blockchain, namely, a ‚Äúmaterialist,‚Äù ‚Äúdesign,‚Äù and ‚Äúemergent‚Äù approach. We then describe moments of dissensus in practice through two cases of online communities, Genesis DAO and Ouishare, discussing their different ways of recognizing and navigating dissensus. Finally, we give a critical overview of consensus algorithms, voting, staking, and forking as the mechanisms that make out blockchain governance ideologies. In conclusion, we argue that dissensus can serve as a useful concept for pointing attention to governance as it is conducted in practice, as h...

Hobbes is famous for his early and elaborate development of what has come to be known as ‚Äúsocial contract theory‚Äù, the method of justifying political principles or arrangements by appeal to the agreement that would be made among suitably situated rational, free, and equal persons. He is infamous for having used the social contract method to arrive at the astonishing conclusion that we ought to submit to the authority of an absolute‚Äîundivided and unlimited‚Äîsovereign power.

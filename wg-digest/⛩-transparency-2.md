Token Engineering Commons

━━WORKING GROUP TEXT━━ / 🕵｜transparency

We help promote transparency, openness and mutual monitoring as the high-level ideal that we're moving towards in the TEC. The way that we get there is by empowering people to share this experience with the Transparency Audits and making information available to everyone. Weekly sync agenda: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jbuqlIXd3s9gRwXbT9ND0zUbE0MaEP9EyO6sHY46iOY/

So it’s a good idea to make the initial buy into the curve The downside is if we try to buy a lot (like 400k) there may be slippage that would actually be a bad deal for us… Also if we buy too much it might dissuade speculators. I love all of these ideas. Let’s figure out a 3 m...

Hi Transparency group! I have a question. I am sometimes able to record sessions that are not otherwise recorded. I don't quite have the capacity in my life to upload and take these videos all the way through the publishing process. Is it OK if I upload videos to the TEC channel as unlisted, and leave them to transparency/communications WG to sort them, annotate them, and publish them? Let me know how this fits into the workflow and if there are any articles/references that I should read up on. Thank you guys so much!!!! I so greatly appreciate this working group.

Hey transparency! From my own experience, and for newbies and veterans alike, some more clarity and info on how proposals (CV and QF-voted) are submitted/quantified/voted is relevant. Given TE, TEC, Cadcad, CS and GitCoin overlaps and if TEC/Trusted Seed is a "vetting" node; exploration, documentation and dissemination of this is missing or taken for granted imo. Thanks for considering this!

Should we do the initial buy into the bonding curve?

The big point here is that… let’s say the token freeze is 1 year… that means that if the Commons wants to buy any TEC in the next year, we can guarantee, the price at the initialization is the cheapest price the DAO.

Hi Zepti

<img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f642.png" width=50 height=50>

Thank you for responding. I probably should have removed that post but left it in "transparency" for the sake of "radical transparency". I feel like I have been able to find answers to my questions (which were poor questions anyway) and that my concerns have turned out to be unfounded. I'm trying hard to do a better job of gathering all the available information for myself without needing my hand held, and understanding all the implications of each proposal/discussion/topic etc without speaking prematurely, blowing a fuse, or worse, "crying wolf". My process of development is proving to be slower than I'd like to admit, but I'm actively doing my best to improve. Thanks for your patience and kindness.

@Zeptimus @iviangita @Juankbell @Tam2140 @natesuits @jh @santteegt: Hello all, I am currently putting together a spreadsheet to be used by all persons involved with the Transparency WG proposal. This document will be used for time & activity tracking as well as the main document used by the multi-sig holders to determine monthly payouts. This document will be made available by the end of the week. A key piece of information that will be required is a valid wallet address in order to received compensation for the work performed. Prior to providing this wallet address please take necessary precautions as your wallet address and username will be made public as part of transparency guidelines. It is advised that all participating members provide a new wallet address that is separate from your main holdings address. There are two options (and please correct me): affected members can submit/post their wallet addresses here in the Transparency WG channel **OR** post the information in the designated locations once the spreadsheet is made available. If there are any questions/concerns please feel free to contact @Zeptimus , @iviangita or myself. (edited)

I’m interested in knowing how transparent we want to be with TEC’s money as it’s set up right now. We can monitor the multisig address with Dune and see every multisig cash flow. (and check on blockscout all the transactions done by the multisig and also the addresses that control that multisig)....

Transparency Audit Report - A New Approach

As we come closer to the Commons Upgrade, we think this is the best time to revisit our transparency audit process and find out where we can improve to make our community more transparent.

_02-Mar-22 07:47 PM_:

Hello WG team. I have fixed the Activity sheet after much contemplation but landed on a fairly easy resolution. Basically if the **To Date** ends on a particular month that is the month those hours will be applied to for distribution and accounting purposes. As an example, all activities for the week of Feb 28 - Mar 6 are calculated and added to the March distribution total. Feb 28 - Mar 06 -> added to Mar hours Mar 28 - Apr 03 -> added to Apr hours April 25 - May 01 -> added to May, if there is no additional May activity this will be the final distribution Please let me know if you have any issues or questions. Thank you. (edited)

_14-Mar-22 01:32 PM_:

@Zeptimus @iviangita There is no link ready for the data I presented today at the Transparency call. I can import that data into the Decision Tracking workbook since it is community data. This will require the creation of 3 additional sheets: Advice Tracking, Advice Audit (Metrics) and Decision Audit (Metrics). Potentially a fourth sheet to show charts and graphs. It is not my document so who do I need to clear this with??? Or I can create a new Google doc, not my recommendation but also not my call. **OR** we can create an Audit Workbook for the entire team but this will require massive duplications of data on my end since all of the metrics will be tied to a different Google Workbook (Decision Tracking).

Just finishing giving some structure to the document, I think it's really close to how it should look to be presented. I would ask to not fill any information until it's discussed a bit more, it's easier to read if it's empty.

_12-Apr-22 10:42 AM_:

I have shared my thoughts on this. Even providing the proposals, link, budget, passed by as shown in the proposal will make the section look sloppy and overly complicated. This is why I created the metrics to put in the respective sections that I have since removed. I can just put a summary in the those sections (i.e. 27 proposals passed, avg. request 45,000 wxDAI, with an average yes vote of 97 %) then provide the link to the spreadsheet for reference. These are the only things I can come up with that will make the section useful, non-repetitive and legible. Out of ideas, every time I look at it, I am out of additional ideas. I don't want to spend the time to later remove everything or a large percentage of it.

the section seems to be causing some disagreements, i must admit i haven't paid proper attention

i will look through it closely and come back with comments

_12-Apr-22 11:27 AM_:

okay i went through it and yeah i have some opinions but i don't know if it's appropriate to voice them now that we're reaching the delivery date and to be fair iirc this section has been discussed several times and i'm not sure why it has been so hard to agree on how to display the information

for the overall audit i worry that putting to much information (like definitions of everything and small and often not that relevant information) will make this audit closer to an entry document sort of like a guide rather than a tool for future analysis.

i know ratio is upset by all the changes and the fault of consensus, we should definitely prioritise finding a way to organise and move forward better and maybe consider reaching out to gravity if the issue is affecting any of you more than what it should

@Zeptimus I am from sampo analystic team. can you hop on a quick call with us? we are trying to figure out how to get data related to money inflow and outflow.

the goal is to understand where money is most spend in each group. and identify a way to reduce this expense if possible.

need help connecting sampo analytic team to people who have access to transaction data. I know that @jh works on DUNE and has data. I notice that getting information outside a team is troublesome. can #🕵｜transparency team create a sheet to list people and responsibility. At least those who get paid should be included, so people know who to contact without asking like what I am doing now.

another thing I suggest is ticket system. Once one submitted a ticket. one just has to wait for responds from TEC support team. TEC support team will be required to organize between themselves. Delegate work on one who ask for help toward support team. (edited)

does anyone in transparency know how to use version control? I really think it should be gold standard of auditing things.

someone please reach out.

$TEC balance and percentage is also wrong.

@Edu - TEC Steward. @iviangita @liviade @Tam2140 - I think it's worth incorporating the covenant into the process of member onboarding. I raise this since we're looking explicitly at what constitutes membership in the TEC as part of our current planning. We have the Terms and Conditions for joining the Discord server and it references portions of the covenant. But just wondering if some sort of agreement to the actual covenant itself should be part of becoming a member, just like the Initial Community Offering, etc. I might also be missing some piece of the puzzle here

Your advice on the Sampo strategy

Provide as much information as possible about your idea. This post grew from the Sampo working group’s high-level strategy document, which you can find below.

just picking up on this idea as part of the communitas conversation today, @Edu - TEC Steward., @liviade, @Tam2140. what if the initial requirements to membership were, as we discussed, praise activation, orientation, initial community offering, and in addition, cryptographically signing this TEC community covenant? Pass these, and you're a member and you get the TEC membership NFT.

@Costa, if we were to do this, it would mean adding these fields to the spreadsheet, and once all are completed, then you have your answer for whether the newcomer has become a member.

I was just about to submit the Sampo funding proposal on Gardens and learned that it's here where we need to first sign the Community Covenant. Works exactly as I would hope, (i.e. with a wallet confirmation and transaction record) - it's just that how many people actually get to this? I wasn't even prompted to do this in order to vote (at least I don't remember that...)

You just have to sign the covenant if creating or challenging proposals

it should be fairly easy to integrate it somewhere so you must post the tx somewhere in the onboarding process but yeah

Hey everyone. Just wondering with pinned posts in Working Groups, which now seem also to include Projects ... I can understand very new projects not having pinned posts, and can see great examples of post pinning, typically the stewards channel was a pick for me. But wouldn't we expect pinned posts in all established WGs? The surprise for me was nothing in Soft Gov ...

I think @jasontphelpsNH and the people in communitas are currently working on updating and homogenizing the pinned posts across WGs.

might be easier to just add a fixed (hidden) column on each of the WG sheets just giving their name, but want to explore this option instead to keep their view simple

_26-Jun-22 03:24 AM_:

just to let you know: I had to make sure the order of columns was correct, and add a hidden column with the WG name (hidden, at position A). I've renamed the sheets I've already adapted to, say, "Sampo WG - TEC Balances" as opposed to "Sampo Budget"

_30-Jun-22 05:09 PM_:

on extracting common pool data in lower level of detail:

[https://github.com/itzmestar/duneanalytics](https://github.com/itzmestar/duneanalytics)

I believe I can extract the history of transactions of any wallet and put it all into google sheets

this may help to audit the actual transactions, balances, and ensure all teams have declared their spending properly to the community

or if we're missing omething

for now just doing the common pool, but just an idea

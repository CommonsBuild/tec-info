The purpose is to check our assumptions about Token Engineers and their needs - as a starting point

_21-Jan-21 04:51 PM_:	The first milestone, it's basically applying what we preach in Ecosystem Valueflows course: 

Check your assumptions - How do we form our assumptions and how do we validate them; in this case specifically our assumptions about Token Engineering the field, Token Engineer, their needs and the environments. We have this great seminal paper on Cryptoeconomics, and  many who drop by on this server are drawn by its challenges, at the same time there is so much crazy-business-as-crypto-usual through the hype cycles of money flushing in, first it was the ICO wave, now the DeFi wave, with its subwaves of stablecoins, now NFTs, and seemingly highspeed tokenswap DAO2DAO networks... 

who knows what's around the corner - but certainly there is a dissonance between "Foundations of Cryptoeconomics" and  "Practice", where does it come from, how are practicing token designers/engineers affected by it, what do they need, what do newcomers from the many disciplines need... Join the conversation! the first task of the group is to come up with the right questions to ask in a community survey.

_01-Feb-21 04:38 PM_:	Updated agenda for **Wednesday 3PM CET**(check your TE calendars:) ) 2nd exploratory meeting on the proposal: "Thanks for your interest in the topic of TE Ethos, research on Token Engineers and their environment! Please find here the updated proposal: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TlkVH8dX1XoiUO57MXMrRzp1-JlQj2sbo4RCEe437PY/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TlkVH8dX1XoiUO57MXMrRzp1-JlQj2sbo4RCEe437PY/edit?usp=sharing) 

This 2nd exploratory call will focus on:
 
(1) "Intrinsic Motivations" - and which questions to ask to get to those, we have Bea &amp; Sparrow from Invisible Economy/DADA.art 
(2) "Ethical Engineering" - and which questions to ask, based on work of Fabian "An Interface to Moral Philosophy for Token Engineers

Goal for the working group, and regular members is to suggest areas of further investigation."

_04-Feb-21 02:53 AM_:	Hey 🙂
Keeping the notes, in the same proposal doc for now- the (2) "Ethical Engineering" we took to the next exploratory meeting 17.2.

One aha moment for me was that extrinsic rewards (KPIs) etc. can have effects on freedom to make ethical choises when an engineer decides on trade-offs (which we have to do all the time) - so that's a carry over and link to the next session

The other one is about "environment" - we can ask indirectly for intrinsic/extrinsic motivation, limiting factors etc. when we ask about the environment that token engineers operate in... which made me think of Andrej again - and in deed the last words in his 1st article about "Building in DeFi" is the following:

_"...Plea for change

Honestly, if this keeps up, we won’t see people trying to innovate in this space, all we see are teams constantly trying to attack each other and break each other down, or teams that come in, do a quick ICO raise, and then dissapear. While this is the status quo, why would anyone try to build something here?

I need to seriously reflect and consider if I still want to be involved in a space this antagonistic and hostile. Especially when I try to do this as a common good...."_

And another one - when I reread his article a year later (he didn't leave, why?): it's right there: **"You have 0% of the reward, 100% of the risk."** - if this isn't the definition of **intrinsic motivation**, it could point to masochastic tendencies 😛

any feedback/questions from all  are very much welcome. We will refine, and group maybe, but would love to make this as comprehensive as possible to help TE "find their punchline" - which we assume to be "ethical TE", "transdisciplinarity", but want to see how much of this ideal is reflected in "real TE life" - and what we can do/help for it to become real, lived Token Engineering Ethos

> Abstract. Effective, legitimate and transparent governance is paramount for the long-term viability of decentralized networks. If the aim is to design such a governance model, it is useful to be aware of the history of decision making paradigms and the relevant previous research. Towards such ends, this paper is a survey of different governance models, the thinking behind such models, and new tools and structures which are made possible by decentralized blockchain technology. Governance mechanisms in the wider civil society are reviewed, including structures and processes in private and non-profit governance, open-source development, and self-managed organisations. The alternative ways to aggregate preferences, resolve conflicts, and manage resources in the decentralized space are explored, including the possibility of encoding governance rules as automatically executed computer programs where humans or other entities interact via a protocol.

_18-Mar-21 04:33 PM_:	[thread]: Sounds good. I also sent you a podcast I did with Rachel Holmes of Metaspace into Telegram and we talked about this a lot during it.

The Decolonization part exists to allow the engineer to see their own minds and the mind as a lens. Colonization is a lens that emphasizes and ratifies Divided Thinking. First Principles have a hard time being seen by someone whose mind is divided, and even if they do see it, their ability to then switch to Unified Thinking is impeded by the long history of Divided validation.

sth to think about and spec out... maybe w/ Electric Circus

@durgadas I really like this... DAOs feel like an empty shell...

anyways wanted to share the talk of yesterday [TokenEngineering @MetaFest 18/3 5:30PM CET](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRkuQViLqcK4sJlj0sRry6tryzjdSIVz3lHrApGD3H20zg7QexG0QbwpqwF1p_rieap5oVXKCayNxdv/pub?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=3000) Look forward to the community survey and finding more aligned aspiring TEs who will appreciate the ethos that emerges here...

this "The current information network has expanded to reach 3.2 billion people, and its information systems have now become a part of every society, market, supply chain, and industry. Designing this network and its systems without governance and ethics in mind has made the Internet an ungovernable and unethical space." but not much more yet http://aletheia.systems/

[thread]: I love the term - "consilience" and its meaning. Actually I am pondering that as the fractal ethos or "WE" ethos in this TE community and all beyond.

### durgadas BOT 24-Mar-21 12:25 PM

Turquoise in Spiral is, at the social quadrant made of Holonic Meshworks, which sounds similar

### Letty BOT 24-Mar-21 12:26 PM

Something as - how did you "spend your time" while the collective human craziness was physically projected? - "I was consiliencing"

[thread]: Yes, right - We've trying to put the turquoise dimension in some digestible questions in the TE questionnaire. So this is a reflection connected to that as well.

### Letty 30-Mar-21 03:33 PM

Yes - I could have (smart?) signed that statement at the moment of issuance. Then there were talks about the "need" of scaling up to 7billion... now within this (wo)man-made chaos the need to go back to basics is more imperative than ever...

Hi all, looks like this may be the right place for this link. [https://civilizationemerging.com/](https://civilizationemerging.com/) I'm sure someone here is familiar with Daniel Schmachtenberger (sp?), but he has an interesting series of posts about the features of a new economy that could be relevant to TE. He's currently working on a project to improve skills related to sensemaking. Anyway, my journey down this rabbit hole was kickstarted by a podcast from him. (edited)

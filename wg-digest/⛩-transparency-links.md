  > The big point here is that… let’s say the token freeze is 1 year… that means that if the Commons wants to buy any TEC in the next year, we can guarantee, the price at the initialization is the cheapest price the DAO. So it’s a good idea to make the initial buy into the curve The downside is if we try to buy a lot (like 400k) there may be slippage that would actually be a bad deal for us… Also if we buy too much it might dissuade speculators. I love all of these ideas. Let’s figure out a 3 m...

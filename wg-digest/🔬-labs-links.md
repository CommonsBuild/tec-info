  > The Token Engineering Commons is building the tools for safe digital economies that protect and support public goods. To·ken En·gi·neer·ing /ˈtōkən/ /enjəˈniriNG/ 1. An emerging engineering discipline focused on holistic systems design and the theory, practice and tools used to design and verify tokenized ecosystems i.e. cyptoeconomic systems and their simulation using tools like cadCAD. 2. A discipline of responsibility; adhering to the highest principles of ethical conduct (from ethical engineering) 3. A community pushing forward the field of token engineering in theory and practice. (See more Modeling Crypto Protocols as Complex Systems, TE Process) Com·mons/ˈkämənz/ 1.

With the support of Block.Science, CommonsStack.org and the Token Engineering Community, a stand alone open-sourced community was launched on July 31, 2020 to explore developing the tools and applications from which value can be created around this technology. On this channel, we document the community developments and related topics around the modeling and simulation of complex systems.

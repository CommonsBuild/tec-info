- [Romeo and Juliet, a Dynamical Love Affair](http://educ.jmu.edu/~strawbem/Sample_Report.pdf)
  > We model the oscillating emotions felt by Romeo and his fair Juliet as they feed on each others passion and indifference in turn. We model this emotional situation using simple, linear differential equations in the style of Strogatz [1, 2]. Using geometric and computational approaches, we observe that this situation results in the never ending cycle of ardor and indifference.

  > This website is the public interface for modeled and observed water temperature and flow data for the Sacramento River associated with Shasta Reservoir, Shasta and Keswick Dam operations, and meteorological conditions. A primary input and assumption of the models is based on the operational conditions forecasted for Shasta and Keswick reservoirs generated by USBR. These forecasts are updated over time and composed of different scenarios of hydrological (dry or wet) and meteorological (warm or cool) conditions. Model outputs from each scenario are displayed.

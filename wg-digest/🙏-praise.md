_19-Apr-21 06:18 AM_:  researching for the book here's the rationale behind praise that does make sense: "The results of the experiment III confirmed the hypothesis and the students' performance increased significantly during the third session in comparison to session one, showing that verbal praise and positive feedback enhances performance in tasks that a person is initially intrinsically motivated to perform. This provides evidence that verbal praise as external reward increases intrinsic motivation. " - just fyi

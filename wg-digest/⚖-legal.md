@Esen has sufficient structured corporate finance and I'm specialising in international IP/IT/ID law, having done a constitution for OpenSource Coop and worked on cooperative frameworks (abeit construction/EPC related). Also have a draft NFT framework which might be ammenable for TEbook/academy. Because this is not an altcoin, normal SEC compliance rules are not suited though what TEC wants to do with bonding curves may come under CFTC oversight.

_27-Oct-20 11:07 PM_:	I've pointed out b4 the 3 initial issues facing TEC,
1. member-member relations
2. group identity (formal judicial entity)
3. accumulation of assets and disbursement of flows

Leaving aside the last 2 (preqs of token design), I'd like to point out the subtle, but important role of **netiquette**. Science (and engineer) is based on peer review, stemming from Enlightenment evidence-based reasoning. This requires a level of **civil discourse** which sets expectations (and thus behavioural norms) of the community. Could be part of on-boarding or bylaws on banning/sinbinning rude actors.

The estimation is that this proposal will become law in few months.

As it is written today it will regualte (the issuance) all the crypto assets = tokens. It will be a game-changer for the EU market and we fear that in many cases not supporting innovation as it statets.

@Marina rules don't apply to cryptoassets offered **BEFORE** the date of entry of MiCA date of entry (2022??) and service providers have 18 months to seek new grant of authority

but it is an important questions. The labour laws in the EU are much stringent that the ones in US, in general I would say they are contractors - if they are doing any work, the beuty of it is that you can define it, to a certain point in the documents, T&amp;C, etc.

> what is the general direction in coming years? 

@drllau yes, there are new laws recently adopted by the EU, which makes crowdfunding much easier. We'll have speacial regulation for issuance and public offering of crypto assets in the future, so the special law is applicable here. It all depands on the timeline.

@Marina which is one of the legal risks i put into the issues ... subcontractors then implies possible VAT-style tax but which is contrary to the EU definition of volunteer which assumes no payment for contributed hours. One legal solution is that instead a straight 1:1 hours:money relationship (note CA rules on trying to reclassify employees as subcontractors), have a prize draw and give away gifts, honoriums or priviledges

Every EU member state has a different labor law and the important part here is the legal practice-the decisions made in court. Also, the legal definiton of praise? , afaiu it is a promise of receiving some tokens in the future and the right to purchase even more tokens for a certain price.

On the other hand, if labor laws would apply, the responsibility of the company too. But this is less probable, since usually, the plaintiff here is the employee.

_10-Nov-20 09:18 PM_:	

@Ruben Russel from the existing lawsuits, there are a number of issues that come up ...
a) legal role of developers ... in MakerDAO there was a fight when the original flat structure got outside investment there was insistence that they became "employees" (with implicit duty of loyalty) which did not go down well with the loose creative studio
b) source of funds (external/internal) ... DASH was originally set up as a US trade association but this limited the amounts that could be "donated". It then restructured itself as a NZ holding trust, a Delaware C-Corp for software development, and the masterNodes (think superminers) as beneficiaries
c) management of contributors ... membership, how people join/leave, disputes between members, concensus on roadmaps ... this is a soft governance (typically club bylaws) but reveals how a group identity gets unified

So look for discussions on deliberate jurisidiction choices or mechanisms put in place to minimise friction

_13-Nov-20 04:03 AM_:	There's quite a few offshore ex-colonial islands. Netherland Antilles, BVI, etc .... as such they've created a niche for themselves in holding companies but tend to be viewed with suspicion by mainstream EU (base tax base erosion). 

The actual key document is the trust deed, which defines the purpose(s) of the original settlor(s). The memorandum of wishes (at least in anglo-sax jurisidiction) tend to be strongly indicative but necessarily binding depending on the discretionary powers assigned in the deed. What then becomes important are how foundation trustees are elected and removed.
                    
My observation of other altcoin is there tends to be 2-4 functions of foundation/trustee (which can be separated legally)

- developer or investment ... actual software or active project management
- operators or service providers, either miners or key infrastructure ... they take on operational risks (eg security)

Patronage dividends are a nice way to go about, basically, it isn't just this instrument but the whole coop structure that is very attractive for the token ecosystem and their distribution. 

I would dare say it doesn't really matter which jurisdiction you're in if a person receives something (praise, token as a dividend or a monetary reward) in a case when they have actually provided their expertise/service and worked for someone - the basis for an employment relationship is provided and such an individual can (should) always have a chance to pursue this recognition at court and be reimbursed for social security and other additional expenses that are covered by an employer (this is especially correct in jurisdictions with a high level of social security provided to workers). Whenever someone uses a different contract to cover up an employment relationship such a contract can be recognised as void under certain circumstances. 

Additionally when workers receive praise or physical assets provided by their company (e.g. bonus points or gift cards to be spent in a store owned by the company they work for) these types of vouchers are often limited (here a worker can only get about 15EUR per year and the voucher should not be spent every single month).

they can either be internal business units (look at MakerDAO) or separate legal entities (eg DASH with NZ trust, C-corp dev team and masternodes represented by protector trustees). The latter takes advantage of jurisdictional strengths whereas former is more direct action in following traditional firm hierarchy.

@drllau That's an interesting distinction. But who defines what a public good is? Usually/in some jusrisdictions the law-the state- the constitution.

Only if can prove that it is not an investment scheme under SEC rules ... the bonding curve adds kink in that theoretically you can get more $$$ out than initially put in. But if legally structured as trust, and gets public benefit status, a lot easier to get tax gift deductibility and a no-action letter from SEC

_20-Nov-20 09:26 PM_:	I'd just note that the MorlockDAO with its concept of "tribute" stems from venture capital antecedents of cost &amp; carry (from a cursory reading of MetaVentures doc). Traditional VC would deduct 2% off upfront (fixed cost of operations/salary) and extract 20% of the residual (carry) after original funds have been returned. DAO version didn't have the same legal force so they allowed rage-quitting at any time taking their original cash out. As you can tell, this makes it highly illiquid, even technically insolvent) so the upfront tribute (fixed cost) was increased.

Some of those Morlock concepts don't carry so well for donating towards public goods. My interpretation is that seeders are offering to **donate** a min-max range to public benefit of improved token design, with the min roughly equating to the Morlock tribute. The reason why you can **perhaps** get back more than the original donation is that by also contributing time or volunteering, you get praise which accumulates towards raising your max level and due to the bonding curve at time of conversion, can get a premium for providing liquidity (xref zero-coupon social accrual bond [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_impact_bond)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_impact_bond))

_21-Nov-20 10:47 PM_:	From my perspective, the biggest risk is that the smart contracts do not implement what is promised in writing. For example the conversion from praise to minted tokens.

the other tech aspect which is not legal but could escalate that way is SecOps, what happens if a multi-sig gets phished and funds get defrauded? OK commonStacks has some initial legal insurance for initial hatchers but after the bonding curve goes open?

It may be of limited use in protecting individual/multisig accounts but may come in use diversifying away from DAI in future. Essentially the DAI deposited for reserve/funding is held in trust upon trust for TE community and if CommonStacks lacks the SecOps or code auditing capabilities, then need to mitigate risks by offloading to someone else

_05-Dec-20 12:12 AM_:	Is there a less tedious way of doing AML, weeding out speculators, and selecting trusted seeds for stewards? At the moment it all comes down to the CommonStack council to vet membership and screen the "trusted" seeds. However, from a token engineering perspective, there are actually 2-4 independent parameters which can be "tuned" to self-select the population
a) the threshold for becoming a steward (presumeably with some community (super)powers vs non-steward ... this can be some activity test favoring regular proactive participation  rather than verbal diarrhea or trolling
b) windfall "tax" ... can make the buyback of tokens limited to a multiple (1.0-5x) of initial contribution ... so stewards can get up to 2-3x whereas speculators capped at 1.0x ... this cap ratio can be adjusted for good/bad leaver behaviour ... eg a steward that neglects duties could have the 2x cap reduced
c) holding (or vesting period) ... the interval that tokens have to be locked up (non-transferrable) .... 
d) tribute tax .. the bonding curve buy/sell differential
e) ??? what else can be used to tune the hatch parameters

_05-Dec-20 10:25 PM_:	@santigs Both these two T&amp;C need to be revised to make clear the legal parties involved and made available for the **2nd** phase of voting (hence urgent but not priority) ... the question then becomes what is the legal obligations (if any) CommonStack has towards the members? ... now if the verein was developing &amp; debugging the code, it would be a direct vendor-user relationship but it looks like more facilitating and onboarding (you're not writing smart contracts), then more onus is on participatory governance by TEC stewards

_07-Dec-20 02:25 AM_:	there are a lot of advantages to co-ops but the disadvantage is capital contributions limited to members. leading to underinvestment as members prefer to take out benefits for themselves rather than accumulate.

_26-Feb-21 09:59 AM_:	Hi @drllau. In most jurisdictions worldwide all type of income is taxable regardless it’s source, however each taxpayer is responsible to declare it in his/her annual tax return. In this regard, I believed we should only inform in the T&amp;C that each individual is fully responsible to comply with tax regulations according to their specific situation (for obvious reasons won’t be the same as per example for a Mexican besides a US Citizen or European)

_26-Feb-21 09:45 PM_:	I note that making TEC tokens non-transferable significantly limits their functionality. I suspect that it is vulnerable to a plutocracy where big external whales can dominate/influence proposals whereas you want the influence to diffuse within the community. Note that from a legal risk perspective, the rules on "money" service does not apply if you can prove it is not a "virtual currency" even though it can be convertible (bonding curve)

_27-Feb-21 02:44 PM_:	My background is in EU, corporate and labor law with expertise as VC and "crypto-projects" advisor.  I've got right now 15 tabs open in my browser with TEC/CS docs and the TEC visual brainstorming. So using this notes as a pad and reminder. Not (yet) a "praised" or trust seed member so coming in as "external participant".

After reviewing the info on the  te-legal regulation channel (all way back), I see that legal conversations/decisions on previous topics raised there are taking place in this channel mainly.       

1. Q's on the "legal structure/back-up" of members, entities and future projects: as per understood, the Swiss Association is intended to provide a first legal framework for individual members regarding the "impact hours" pre-hatch and post-hatch. There's a $10k cap on liabilities - can pls someone or @santigs clarify if this cap applies only to "activities" previous to hatching the DAO? Or if that was the best starting legal figure implemented to "protect" the first trusted seed member of the CS. 

2. Q's on the need for further "legal design" in terms of how this DAO will operate. I've seen 2 different models put forward (MorlockDAO vs DASH).  Given the different implications of both structures - has there been more "high-level" thinking or conversations around the  "ethos" the TEC want to embed itself within? This connected with being qualified as a "trust" or "endowment" therefore avoiding or minimising some fiscal implications (IRS or EU-related?)

3. Q's on the Licensing Agreements/IP/IT between the devs and the "DAO governance" - this connects with the post-hatch phase and being more or less "decentralised" and T&amp;C's evolving in that way.

4. Q's on future strategy: using recent and ongoing legal cases in the DAO space (see Aragon/Eth fork/Unit) to develop alternatives.

_02-Mar-21 08:26 PM_:	
> first legal framework for individual members 

Right, but primarily because CommonStack is shepherding the process and easier to spin-out (think like yeast cell budding) from existing UnincorpAssoc

> 2.  qualified as a "trust" or "endowment" therefore avoiding or minimising

This question revolves around what risks CommonStack retains ... for example making the TEC token transferable adds more paperwork when transactions &gt;$3k but gives more flexible tokenomic design. The endowment concept shifts onus away from the "investing" and more towards "donation" which is closer to a non-profit. However, no discussions as yet to a post-hatch legal structure ... see

> 3. Q's on the Licensing Agreements/IP/IT between the devs and the "DAO governance"

This part of the non-for profit yet to be fleshed out ... the proposals should result in CreativeCommons output but whether is it a dedicated devTeam (a la DASH) or ad hoc working groups is no stipulated

> 4. Q's on future strategy: using recent and ongoing legal cases in the DAO space

It is evolving ..., in some ways, doing this for the first time could help establish international framework agreements which can be used as bullet-tested umbrella for future DAOs

#1: 

The 10k cap applies to any activity in a DAO/Commons that the Association supports undertaken in good faith by a Member of the Swiss Assn. This is sort of weird cause its not work done by the Assn... but work done by other "general parternship" DAOs

The Commons Stack Assn is taking full responsibility for the work done by developers and other contributors to create the tools that other communities can use to launch themselves

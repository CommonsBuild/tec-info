_23-Nov-20 09:16 PM_:	Applying systems thinking, the other approach is to measure "conflict" (however defined) and create a damping feedback loop so designated community stewards get tokens reduced for increasing conflict levels and praise for rapidly resolving. **It takes a village to raise a child**

_26-Nov-20 09:56 AM_:	@Dulce This is the agenda for today:
1. Do you think conflict management should be done with or without a group of people designated to hold accountable for it (Ostrom says Monitors should be accountable to the appropiators or are the appropiators themselves) - So its a) the capacity to manage a conflict is shared between all members or b)designated people are responsible for it
2. what would be boundary of this internal management layer that is proposed? can we have support and legitimaty in both the TEC and de broader TE space, or will it be seen as a "state intervention"
3. How can we apply TE (modeling,simulation, analysis) to make ur conflict management smarter -The initial propose is really a human layer to facilitate communication between stakeholders and provide ADR mechanisms

Punished By Rewards is, I think a way to shine a light on some of the systems we've put in place. Even the Praise System itself might feel less like a good idea after you read it.
                    
When I heard the name of the conflict resolution group was called Gravity, I thought it was great since it pulls all of us together.

_26-Nov-20 01:34 PM_:	I'm showing all this as a result of our own desire to meet the need I hear in the group to have actual data to work with. Alfie Kohn is the one really clear voice for using actual data and studies to show the problems with all punishment/reward systems. We often repeat these punishment/reward systems even though the people participating in them do not really want them, they have become so used to how they work they are in our subconscious assumptions. I see those echoes even in this group, even though I have been made to feel very welcome generally by such an inclusive group.

And if there is going to be a conflict, it seems to me that what is going to happen is inside one of these punishment/reward systems buried in the collective psychological shadow of the group.

_03-Dec-20 02:56 PM_:	I can't make the Thursday calls in the next couple of weeks, but the area of managing communication is my expertise. When speaking about communication, it's useful to think about the actual terminology. Our words create the world. Using the terminology "conflict resolution" is going to create conflicts to resolve. Yes, conflicts are inevitable and often good, and at the same time it might be framed differently. Similarly, the terminology "NonViolent Communication" implies that communication could be violent. Other disciplines do not have that attitude and represent personal responsibility both on the output and input sides (what you hear and how you hear it). I would be happy to help but I would like you to guide me in what ways my contribution could be most useful.

_03-Dec-20 03:02 PM_:	Compassionate Communication is an alternate name for this approach of Rosenberg's as well. I have the same observations about Ostrom's work, which is also very colonized in it's thinking when you read the book.

<h3>GraceRachmany#9780  <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/519634011908341760/c599ceae790b944e0dca6259b445526e.png" width="25" height="25" /></h3>

_03-Dec-20 03:06 PM_:	Not sure what "colonized" means in this context. One of the issues that I'm seeing in conversation now is this idea of "fragility" where people can't be with certain communications. Being offended, hurt, etc., by communication can cause a situation where everyone is walking on eggshells and there are certain things that can't be said. Training people to be anti-fragile and just face the "offense" when it happens is an important part of the training. One of the disadvantages of some kinds of training is that it only seems to work well if everyone in the conversation is "obeying the rules" or trained in that form of communication. It is possible to train people in a sort of communication that allows absolutely full communication with anyone, at any time, in any situation.

_03-Dec-20 03:15 PM_:	Well, I do think it's not invaluable to keep in mind the history of the cultural context in which we're speaking. This is, like Neil Postman speaks about a kind of "thermostatic response" to the imbalance in a cultural dialectic. So, if one is to speak with a proper context one can understand the needs and feelings underlying someone's experience, rather than invalidating it. This is indeed a compassionate approach. So colonization did happen and the echoes of this reverberate in certain populations today and the cultural frameworks of violence, exclusion and assumption still exist in those cultures today and often without our ability to consent or opt-out of them. Thus, it is in this way I see the titling of Marshall Rosenberg's work. I was agreeing with you in the sense that you mentioned the terminology of "Non-Violent" implies violence and apart from the reasons I listed above, I am saying Ostrom's book contains terms like "Third World" which is fundamentally a term used in the sense of colonization. Indeed, the monetary system is set up much the same way as we heard from the Spirit Foundation in the call just now.

I think it's in this group's potential to avoid such scenarios and work toward subverting such assumptions to the degree to which we can.

_03-Dec-20 03:29 PM_:	Hello Grace! so happy to see you here, i remember a statement you were developing on the crypto law lab about how most economic profit is not valuable for humankind, look forward to be able to keep having dialogues with you. Also i understand that "conflict management" and "graduated sanctions" can be troublesome terms, but to be antifragile as humans and then also as organizations is to be able to manage our conflicts and behave according to social agreements, that in our case are descentralized, so initially i like those terms.

So it's not necessarily bad to refer to general concepts when you are developing a statement over them -using them as a variable for further conceptualization-.

_03-Dec-20 03:42 PM_:	One could see, for example, Mona Eltahawy's The Seven Necessary Sins For Women and Girls as a similar issue around feminism-as-response-to-oppression

So, from where I sit, this kind of understanding is key to understanding how to arrive at a balance, but especially when we are building the tools underneath economies. The unwise application of a principle or an assumption on the part of the framers of this tech can easily have implications that might exist only in the subconscious of the people framing it. And it is this I am eager to shine a light on so we can avoid those problems down the line when pressures are high not only for time.

_03-Dec-20 03:54 PM_:	These are fair perspectives,. Personally, I try to stay out of framing everything in an oppressor/oppressed framework. I think it's a bit overused today and also doesn't respect the fact that the power dynamic is a normal and natural cycle of personal and societal development. We are at a new cycle of development which will include and transcend,. My sense is that some of the oppressed/oppressor dialogue is fixated with setting things right or repairing some damage, rather than seeing this as part of a developmental progression that had to be passed through in order to reach the next level.

Repairing the past is always doomed to failure. As humans, we are designed to move in a linear forward progression in the temporal dimension.

_03-Dec-20 04:28 PM_:	Well, if it was something left long ago in the past then I wouldn't be mentioning it. It's alive in our cultural "legacy codebase" up to this minute. Being aware of those influences is really all I'm talking about here. If none of that existed, we wouldn't have any need for conflict resolution at all.

_05-Dec-20 10:30 PM_:	it is partly social signalling (shunning/exile) and partly netiquette (as to what is acceptable). Because of lack of physical proximity, IMHO the token is a proxy representation of reputation and social standing. In extremis there may be legal sanctions (like confiscation in case of fraud).

_06-Dec-20 08:40 AM_:	Hey  We are researching various alternative justice approaches and models, to take what we consider the best of them for the design of our our own (for decentralized communities).  The initial discussion is showing us two scopes on monitoring capabilities. 1) where a group of people is held accountable for providing ADR to the community, and 2), where the community itself proposes procedures to moderate themselves (like Chatham House rules for selected topics). I see benefits in both of them and think we can have mixed approaches.

_10-Dec-20 09:41 AM_:	Hello Everyone! Today's Gravity Wg agenda is the following:

Icebreaker question: If you were some type of edible, what would you be? 😂

1. Keep promoting the use of the Typeform [https://the-commons-stack.typeform.com/to/rCVsK5RK](https://the-commons-stack.typeform.com/to/rCVsK5RK) 
2. Can we have consent that having a group of members inside the community that is accountable of facilitating ADR for the community is still mutual-monitoring? and that there is no external influence on them. Why? 

a) The monitors are the members of the community
b) Everyone can fill the typeform and inform issues, even with conflict managers.

_13-Dec-20 09:30 AM_:	I'm researching a lot and i can see truth in various theories, but i'm trying to ground everything to take the best to of each and tailor simple, conflict management mechanisms. We want legitimate and effective spaces to deal with disputes, and i can understand this economical and philosophical holistic theories, but still see them difficult to connect for the purpose of the Gravity group.

_07-Jan-21 12:12 PM_:	4 types of listening by Otto Scharmer
**Dowloading**: This type of listening is limited to reconfirming what we already know. Nothing new penetrates our bubble.
**Factual listening**: We let the data talk to us and notice disconfirming information. Doing this requires opening the mind — that is, the capacity to suspend our habits of judgment.
**Empathic listening:** We see the situation through the eyes of another. Doing this requires opening the heart: using our feelings and our heart as an organ of tuning in to another person’s view.
**Generative listening:** We listen for the highest future possibility to show up while holding a space for something new to be born.

_26-Jan-21 01:18 PM_:	My thoughts as I'm in this SoftGov meeting: Accountability is the tension between the creation of trust and the resolution of conflict, since something "not done" in a participatory democracy is a kind of "conflict" in a broad sense.

_27-Jan-21 10:42 AM_:	I agree. Lack of accountability breaks trust, and without trust mutual accountability measures might be perceived as aggressive, but people have different thresholds for acquiring or losing trust. It's definitely a puzzle

This affects all of the repositories that were formerly under the TECommons organization. So our coordination repo but also tec-sourcecred, TokenLog-SoftGov, tec-sourcecred-dashboard. The TEC Github organization name has changed! Repository links are automatically updated BUT any links directly to the organization name and subdirectories that are not repositories will need to be updated. **If you are using local repositories, you will have to update those**! No change for Zenhub as it links directly to repositories. [https://github.com/CommonsBuild](https://github.com/CommonsBuild) (Formerly [https://github.com/TECommons)](https://github.com/TECommons))

I checked to make sure the Tokenlog site was working as expected, it is. <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f609.png" width=20 height=20>

The URL name still has TECommons in it (

[https://tokenlog.xyz/TECommons/TokenLog-SoftGov)](https://tokenlog.xyz/TECommons/TokenLog-SoftGov))

but it is linked directly to the repository so does not appear to be affected by the github name change. Might be prudent to have the devs take a closer look to make sure nothing unexpected happened on the backend.

"Developmental Principles It may seem strange to say, but most organizations‚Äîeven most well-functioning, ad-mired organizations‚Äîare not actually run on some set of principles, known throughout the organization, driving the daily practice of everyone‚Äôs work, visible to even a casual observer. Yes, most organizations have mission statements. They have purposes. They have goals. They have procedures. They have employee manuals. They may also have mottos or mantras that reflect principles‚Äî‚Äúthe client comes first‚Äù; ‚Äúsomething only we can do‚Äù; ‚Äúshowing up every day‚Äù; ‚Äúprogress is our most important product.‚Äù But without a pervasive ecology‚Äîstructures, practices, tools, and shared language that allows the organization to embody and orient to these values in an ongoing way‚Äîthey become slogans rather than drivers of how the culture runs. In a DDO, the ‚ÄúNorth Star‚Äù of the organization is a set of deeply held principles that animate daily decisions. Genuinely enacting shared principles is itself notable, but in a DDO, it is the content of the principles that is even more remarkable. A DDO‚Äôs principles share a common fundamental belief in the power of individual growth for members of the organization. We see four related ways that growth-focused principles together anchor a collective developmental focus in a DDO."

@everyone **I have a confession!** I think I broke TokenLog. I voted a couple days ago and wanted to throw a couple votes on my proposal, I voted.. nothing changed on my screen. I voted again... same thing, nothing.. I ended up doing this like 6 or 7 times and it never worked. The next day Griff tells me I have over 200 votes and now somehow I have a negative VP balance.

I'm sorry, I'm a fraud. (edited)

_12-Apr-21 09:08 AM_:

Indeed. A fix has been implemented. So duplicate voting shouldn't be possible anymore. But I'd like community support before updating/removing any votes. Because it's hard to see which are duplicates actually and would rely on voters as well to cleanup

Alternatively, we could remove everything and start the vote from 0

hmm that's a hard decision to make. I think for the sake of credibility and transparency it would be best to clear them all? Anyone else has thoughts? @markop @griff (üíú, üíú) @Tam2140 @Juankbell @Zeptimus @santigs @mitch (üçî, üçî) @freedumbs00 (edited)

_12-Apr-21 10:29 AM_:

personally I would clear them, don't push for new proposals

focus hard on getting people to vote and take some time on the softgov call to vote

then announce the winner on the community call thursday?

[thread]: I can get an overview of all votes/addresses. And try to compare that vs actual balances. At least to filter out if any went above their voting power

but yeah, clearing them would probably be most reliable

I imagine that must be hard especially because of the quadratic distribution and the high balances almost everyone has no? I think it's ok if we clear them and communicate there was a bug.

No, you can't. The idea was that people would vote on backlog items and only 'release' votes again once an item is resolved. The plus/minus functions are only for setting the value, before placing your vote. You can't recover once voted

one more question, are the votes locked just on Tokenlog? Let's say there was a Conviction Voting session happening at the same time, would someone be able to stake their CSTK somewhere else?

No, it's soft governance, so nothing is locked/staked or happening on-chain. Just registering signatures. You're completely free to vote elsewhere

what is the difference between 90 and 1858 votes?

_15-Apr-21 03:33 PM_:

90 individual votes. E.g. One could‚Äôve voted for 200 votes first and a second time for another 100. Which totaled to 1858

Tokenlog wasn't designed that way, tbh, but more as a continuous backlog management/prioritization tool. There are no voting periods or sessions and the votes remain 'open' as long as the issues on the board remain open. Would that work, or what would you like to do next? Happy to chat more about it as well. Gathering all this feedback for the next release (edited)

_16-Apr-21 04:24 AM_:

I personally think that TokenLog and TEC and how they interact should be very separate but appreciate each other. I like it more as a tool and just let it be a tool. How anyone uses that tool is up to them.

Thanks, Juan Carlos. It's also worth noting that a common way - including examples like this where she was the featured speaker at the event - the second principle is often cited as "2. Match rules governing use of common goods to local needs and conditions."

_07-Jun-21 04:46 PM_:

hey everyone, I would love your opinion on something! Celeste was approved today according to our forum voting process, but I'm surprised no one blocked it or even asked any questions about it. One option is that we did a good job on explaining it, or the other is that people weren't informed enough. Any thoughts on the legitimacy of the forum voting process as it is, or if we should review how we make soft decisions?

both IH and CSTK tokens come from praise, the first is given during TEC quants, and the second during Commons Stack quants. Since we chose to use the Trusted Seed and the CS Swiss Association for the hatch both this tokens are playing a role in the TEC.

_23-Jun-21 04:56 AM_:
I do not know, how much of it is now a technical matter; @sem(üå∏,üêù) mentioned yesterday, that there are things that just cannot be done anymore because well hard-coded in smart contracts and state machine. However, I believe it's been a crucial oversight (although pointed out very early on in Working Group 0 <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f609.png" width=20 height=20>

Sept 2020), that will potentially cause Trusted Seed/Association as a gate to be able to govern the public goods (and Token Engineering community is only carrying out the work - which I don't agree as I see

*the whole transdicsiplinary*

work as "intellectual investment". So this being able to make decisions in this commons is not dependent on one's intellectual investment; but monetary investment and association with a certain organization; which leads to a pyramid structure. A condition that isn't related at all to the health of Token Engineering Public Goods. What I have been proposing on numerous occasions is to have the #1 project that TEC funds is how to overcome that initial design trade-off that has been made (as explained in the link and forum). That would require documenting the drawbacks created by the design choices (as it has been started with praise analysis), gather these insights, and based on collective analysis from mutliple perspectives (e.g. solely adhering to Ostrom's Principles, isn't aligned with TE Principles - we know all models are wrong, or plain out dangerous if taken out of context).


I also think it is a stron indicator, if people who used to work in CommonsStack did not see this problem, until they started "working as TEs"

This isn't a critique or negative view - unless we do not learn from data/signals that are growing

_23-Jun-21 05:07 AM_:

as far as I understand only thing that has been a design choice for the community, is the parameters - not the model nor the architecture. So my proposal would be after the hatch model and architecture redesign; however if it isn't hard coded now (i.e. if people do not see the issue and agree it should be part of the hatch agreement), we can be sure, it will not happen. So, I'm kind of dreading making proposals which from game theoretic / incentives perspective aren't likely to get resources they would require.

Or we keep the prevailing narrative: which is TEC nurtures TE, i.e. it is funding opportunity for TE proposals that are of benefit to the entire TE community - something like a a more specialized gitcoin. Which you only get to govern if you are in associated with CommonsStack/Trusted Seed of CommonsStack, which is a valid rule - but not necessary

I do not know, how much of it is now a technical matter; @sem(üå∏,üêù) mentioned yesterday, that there are things that just cannot be done anymore because well hard-coded in smart contracts and state machine. However, I believe it's been a crucial oversight (although pointed out very early on in Working Group 0  Sept 2020), that will potentially cause Trusted Seed/Association as a gate to be able to govern the public goods (and Token Engineering community is only carrying out the work - which I don't agree as I see *the whole transdicsiplinary* work as "intellectual investment". So this being able to make decisions in this commons is not dependent on one's intellectual investment; but monetary investment and association with a certain organization; which leads to a pyramid structure. A condition that isn't related at all to the health of Token Engineering Public Goods. What I have been proposing on numerous occasions is to have the #1 project that TEC funds is how to overcome that initial design trade-off that has been made (as explained in the link and forum). That would require documenting the drawbacks created by the design choices (as it has been started with praise analysis), gather these insights, and based on collective analysis from mutliple perspectives (e.g. solely adhering to Ostrom's Principles, isn't aligned with TE Principles - we know all models are wrong, or plain out dangerous if taken out of context). <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f609.png" width=20 height=20>

_23-Jun-21 05:18 AM_:

My intervention yesterday was more in the line of not to create an interventionist culture as in the future things will be much difficult to change. It is difficult to create tokens or remove funds from the DAO vaults when they are life. In my opinion our dao is already life even it's not yet in the blockchain and I think it is better to get used to it and accept that the things we are doing every day are as if they were set into stone.

So to clarify, technically it's possible to change the distribution of IH before the hatch, it's only my opinion that is against to do that.

as far as I understand only thing that has been a design choice for the community, is the parameters - not the model nor the architecture. So my proposal would be after the hatch model and architecture redesign; however if it isn't hard coded now (i.e. if people do not see the issue and agree it should be part of the hatch agreement), we can be sure, it will not happen. So, I'm kind of dreading making proposals which from game theoretic / incentives perspective aren't likely to get resources they would require.

_23-Jun-21 05:30 AM_:

The design has two parts, the hatch dao and the commons dao. The hatch dao outputs are an initial set of token holders and the funds split in two vaults that are sent to another dao (possiblity a commons dao). The commons dao is a 1hive gardens with a bonding curve because it's the most close thing we have to the original commons stack designs. However the hatch can migrate the tokens and the funds to the dao it pleases, and could be different proposals of daos that people could potentially vote during the commons upgrade. We are still defining the shape of the commons dao in this post: [https://forum.tecommons.org/t/pseudo-code-and-permission-tables-for-the-commons-upgrade/431](https://forum.tecommons.org/t/pseudo-code-and-permission-tables-for-the-commons-upgrade/431)

We are trying to cut the scope and only add the bonding curve and the migration tools in the commons upgrade vote, but the discussion is open and ongoing in both params and commons swarm meetings.

_01-Jul-21 10:10 AM_:

Hey @ygg_anderson @JessicaZartler @Suga yes I think a vote to extend the timeline doesn't belong to Tokenlog because it's adding another topic while splitting the votes.

Usually the forum would be the best place for a decisions like this, but we have been practicing using the weekends to make decisions there. Like proposing until friday and closing the votes on monday

@ygg_anderson I hear you on needing more time to look into this, but consider we'll have the runoff until the 6th. The top 3 to 5 proposals will make it to the next round, we'll prepare the runoff during Gravity tonight, hope you can join

If you close your issue, all the votes there will go back to the wallets. so you can still use your full power to the IH proposals

The dynamics of the decision space are very interesting as well as this process seems to be illiciting the polarity and also the choice to use quadratic voting versus one person one vote in that it doesn't show how many individuals support change vs. no change that we may want to reconsider in discussion of the final vote

liviade BOT 01-Jul-21 11:34 AM

what process is eliciting which polarities? (re @JessicaZartler: The dynamics of the decision space are very interesting as well as this process seems to be illiciting the polarity - i.e. no change and change completely - and also the choice to use quadratic voting versus one person one vote in that it doesn't show how many individuals support change vs. no change that we may want to reconsider in discussion of the final vote)

we don't have a good tool for one person one vote unfortunately. The forum would limit us quite a lot here

but we can open a signaling vote in the forum to try understanding this better. We can have a poll that asks - did you vote for intervention, for mild intervention or for no intervention?

and have a sense there

_01-Jul-21 12:42 PM_:

I'm following with curiosity this 'decision space'. Also went quickly through all the proposals as of now. What is clear is that this decision affects both the past and future of TEC. (edited)

There's a clash and incongruence between stated values/agreements and the voting/tools to inform and enforce those. Quadratic voting (as expected by academic literature) is a tool to maximize decision efficiency around common resource allocation. It's not and can't be a mechanism to signal preferences around alternative uses or categories.

Thanks Letty for your thoughts here, definitely! It is very hard in this nascent field as we are still identifying the tools that need to be built to handle some of these decisions.

No one is an expert and we are exploring in this new space and it is definitely challenging to address this incongruence as you mention but we are learning together and very much appreciate your input <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f64f.png" width=50 height=50> <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f3fc.png" width=20 height=20>

(re @geleeroyale_bot: Letty There's a clash and incongruence between stated values/agreements and the voting/tools to inform and enforce those. Quadratic voting (as expected by academic literature) is a tool to maximize decision efficiency around common resource allocation. It's not and can't be a mechanism to signal preferences around alternative uses or categories.)

Exploring Polycentric Governance in Web3 Ecosystems Workshop

In part one of two workshops, Jeff Emmett, Jessica Zartler, Renzo D'Andrea and Livia Deschermayer of Commons Stack, Block Science, Token Engineering Commons and Change the River, share two frames for governance research and design: The Decision Space & The Voting Space. In these knowledge sharing and interactive sessions, they discuss the import...

Also would be interesting to see how many individuals voted for each proposal - and add no change vs. change results as well to look at that signal. Interesting to note that 7 individuals voted for #1 and 11 individuals voted for #5. It would be interesting to run a one person one vote process and analyze those results. I like Tamara's idea of using Tokenlog as 1P1V as the whale factor is obviously going to sway the voting - i.e. those stakeholders who have the most praise - the center of the debate - have a larger influence, which is the whole center of the debate in everyone having more equal voice. 1P1V is the way to weigh everyone's voices equally. I don't think we can think about a one and done decision process, but think of this as a signal collection process, that we then integrate. In regards to the run off, my understanding was that this was sense making, then we would look at the voices and integrate into new proposals - i.e. 900 votes signalled they wanted to restore IHs to paid contributors in three similar proposals. This should be figured into the runoff, integrated into a proposal. All that being said, I think we can do it in a time frame that still works for the hatch, but would like to dig further into discussions around the decision space, and doing it in a way that honors the voices of those who cast their votes, and those voices being integrated into runoff proposals - as equal.

If your proposal is not going to pass, you have the ability to close the proposal to release the tokens associated with it, thus they can be cast on another proposal.

Just wanted to let people know that I‚Äôve been following the praise debate (praise-gate?). It raises interesting questions about political ignorance (people who could vote but chose not to or voted but maybe didn‚Äôt understand the consequences). Having proposals that arguably overlap thereby lessening their chance for success. The means by which people on the edges of these debates even found out a debate was happening or where to go to learn more about beyond just a proposal. Whether one wallet one vote or vote by magnitude of coins one possesses is better. These, to me, seem like really common problems DAOs are going to face going forward.

hey @JeffEmmett @griff (üíú, üíú) as I'm working on the sheet, one question comes up that is contribution over time. Some people have a high activity now but just joined in feb for ex, as other people have medium but are here since october. How should we approach this?

I'm hoping the curve @ygg_anderson will bring in, following somehow the praise scores we have will solve this? (edited)

Unpaid Bonus Factor = A person's % of hours deducted out of the total hours they earned The Factor is then multiplied against the bucket weight and normalized so that the lowest one is 40%

@JeffEmmett, YGG and I were debating just now

cause originally the deduction you proposed was 33% (framed as a 50% bonus


but now a lot of people will be getting a fraction of that

so we thought that to keep the average deduction around 33% and as a tip of the hat to Tam's proposal, we could do it for 40%?

or should we stick with 33% as the max and go down from there

Hello guys!

Wanted to ask if anyone has any resources or knows how does different utilities from tokens work within an ecosystem?

We mainly followed Ostrom's suggestion to frame it into this 2 questions: Is this required - is this forbidden? anything that is not required or forbidden is allowed (edited)

We need to polish/update them and see what is missing

I would also be curious to your thoughts independent of the process we had so far and how they make sense to you

thanks for taking this on!

Hey @anna-marie, how is the agreements process going? Do you need any help/support with it? I'll be posting the community covenant in the forum for advice process today, and think would be great to add the agreements there

perhaps end of next week would be a good time to have them if possible. Let me know if you think it needs more time, ideally they can be shared for advice process soon too! and again, thanks so much for working on this! (edited)

We're still organising our first meeting so it won't be done this week. Since many of the team members are navigating the TEC for the first time, I'm thinking this will still take us a couple of weeks so end of next week might be pushing it. Let me share an update once we've met - hopefully we'll have a better idea then of the scope of this and everyone's availability

_30-Aug-21 10:53 AM_:

A non urgent thought: reading through The Cultural Build page of the handbook ([https://app.gitbook.com/@token-engineering-commons/s/tec-handbook/what-is-the-tec/the-cultural-build)](https://app.gitbook.com/@token-engineering-commons/s/tec-handbook/what-is-the-tec/the-cultural-build)) it strikes me that we might need to do a little rethinking on how we're representing the Trusted Seed here. Reading the handbook, the impression that I'm left with is that only TS members can join the TEC community, but that's not true. There are actually two types, or layers, of membership happening here. The first is actually a system that is completely open - i.e. anyone can join our server and come to our meetings and work on tasks etc. - but then we have Trusted Seed members, who can give their input to a level of TEC build that non-TS members can't. Perhaps we could edit this to reflect these two types of members and what the difference is (and why we have both?).

I cant remember who asked... but this is a great example of a vote that would benefit from ranked choice voting: [https://forum.giveth.io/t/reallocate-all-eth-in-giveth-dac-on-trace-for-reg-rewards/102/2](https://forum.giveth.io/t/reallocate-all-eth-in-giveth-dac-on-trace-for-reg-rewards/102/2)

Reallocate all ETH in Giveth DAC on Trace for Reg Rewards?

You can choose multiple choices‚Ä¶ was that intended? Off-Topic This is a great example of a poll that would benefit from Ranked Choice Voting‚Ä¶

[How to build a company where the best ideas win - Ray Dalio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXbsVbFAczg)

What if you knew what your coworkers really thought about you and what they were really like? Ray Dalio makes the business case for using radical transparency and algorithmic decision-making to create an idea meritocracy where people can speak up and say what they really think -- even calling out the boss is fair game. Learn more about how these...

![https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HXbsVbFAczg/maxresdefault.jpg](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HXbsVbFAczg/maxresdefault.jpg)

despite the weird title, this is a good perspective on collective intelligence and feedback loops

A non urgent thought: reading through The Cultural Build page of the handbook (

[https://app.gitbook.com/@token-engineering-commons/s/tec-handbook/what-is-the-tec/the-cultural-build)](https://app.gitbook.com/@token-engineering-commons/s/tec-handbook/what-is-the-tec/the-cultural-build))

it strikes me that we might need to do a little rethinking on how we're representing the Trusted Seed here. Reading the handbook, the impression that I'm left with is that only TS members can join the TEC community, but that's not true. There are actually two types, or layers, of membership happening here. The first is actually a system that is completely open - i.e. anyone can join our server and come to our meetings and work on tasks etc. - but then we have Trusted Seed members, who can give their input to a level of TEC build that non-TS members can't. Perhaps we could edit this to reflect these two types of members and what the difference is (and why we have both?).

_07-Sep-21 01:24 AM_:

I was kind of saying the same thing yesterday to @Edu - TEC Steward. , and my understanding now is that the safeguarding component and Swiss Association elements are for folks taking part directly in a hatch. I haven't got to that point yet, but it is a long term ambition! Ironically the governance / Ostrom focus that is needed beforehand and during set up is the more open and understandable part so far! And I'm still exploring that part, because the energy levels are so enticing. So I'm getting a stage 1 - understand governance and community - feeling, and then a stage 2, do you want to hatch a token of your own, feeling. It seemed odd to me that the Swiss Association was coming up first thing, and I was trying to locate it within the TEC ecosystem, but now I think I'm clearer. It does feel more like a stage 2 component, though, I wonder whether others will agree?

Hello Soft-govers ... looking for feedback There is a part of the TEC Agreements that I'm going over I was hoping to get some  's on. I know zilch about what I have circled...I read this and went okay tollgate fees can come back if something is installed...what happens if it isn't? <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f440.png" width=20 height=20>

Does the answer to that need to live in this document or is this question irrelevant?

_07-Sep-21 01:32 AM_:

My instinct always with the this is to draw a process diagram. There's also a high level of "technical language" for us "noobs". That means maybe more diagrams to help understand the difference between conviction voting, disputable voting and Dandelion voting. Instinctively I am wanting to say that there are different levels of document working whenever a product is released to users. The terms and agreements are one thing, user instructions usually another. But this feels like a larger topic, hence ... Ping @anna-marie @Edu - TEC Steward.

Wonderful notes, I feel I'm truly among friends. "No one knows everything" @natesuits , start here, it means we all know stuff other people don't, and vice versa, and we just have to find out which is which. Yes, we have to stick our head up above the parapet to find out, but in a safe, supportive, and compassionate environment, we can be encouraged to do so. And Ostrom's principles give that every chance of happening. And yes, saying I don't know does take courage, I remember one boss being astonished when I said this, my having joined the company literally days before. Unusually, in the corporate world, he did finally get his come uppance, he wasn't a terribly nice guy. I'm so glad to be with you guys, who I would call proper human beings!

hey @natesuits you mentioned voting rituals the other day. Did you have any thoughts on what types of rituals we should have?

I assume the voting in the weekends one never really took off

I've cleaned up most of the suggested edits in the glossary and added a few edits/comments myself, but had a few general questions about the glossary


‚ÄúMore Info‚Äù vs ‚ÄúDeep Dive‚Äù ‚ÄúMore Info‚Äù indicates a link to a source external to TEC while ‚ÄúDeep Dive‚Äù links are to the TEC forum posts. Do we want to keep this distinction or is it okay to have all the additional links be ‚ÄúMore Info‚Äù? Abbreviations (DAO & DeFi) I typically use the non-abbreviated form the first time the term is used. Do we prefer DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) or Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)?

Also, will the glossary remain a google doc or will it be changed to a different format? Just want to make sure adding links to other glossary entries wouldn't be a waste of time.

Hey, if I'm keeping it simple: Consolidate proposals and hold a celebratory Voting day event once every three weeks and a debate around proposals the day before. Here are some of my thoughts on it:

Ideas on creating Voting Rituals

Ideas on creating Voting Rituals So, the intention of these ideas are to create a rhythm to our voting processes. Creating a rhythm around voting benefits us in a couple of ways; first it allows us to develop new forms of communal behavior that both inform and celebrate the practice of voting, ...

spending some time

**empathising**

with the user types who are having those problems that were listed last call by making an empathy map and example user journeys. This helps us discover where they're experiencing problems and how frustrating it is <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f539.png" width=20 height=20>

Then we can find the areas/functionality/features causing those problems at this time <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f539.png" width=20 height=20>

Then we can start thinking of how we can improve those functionalities by turning the problem statement to "How could we.." <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f539.png" width=20 height=20>

From the "How could we.." statements, generate ideas on how to solve the problems (edited)

i'm so into what y'all are doing with this doc and getting things figured out with decision making . . . and i'm also wary of TEC re-inventing the wheel. like, can we find collaborators to help facilitate decision making processes that don't have a high level of context and are just there to guide us through the decision obstacle course? i'm not ready yet but i know that my DAO will be a facilitators guild and i'm really excited about it <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f60a.png" width=20 height=20>

hey @Tam2140 @natesuits @Zeptimus @griff (üíú, üíú) and whoever is interested - do you think having this steps for funding proposals is too much? I thought about: 1. Post your proposal in the Community Advice section in the Forum 2. Incorporate feedback if necessary 3. Post your final proposal on Conviction Voting in the forum 4. Use the CV forum link to submit your proposal to the Conviction Voting Dapp (edited)

alternatively they could be posted directly to Conviction Voting in the forum, but I'm taking the 75% as an example and how that forum thread was super full and difficult to understand if someone was just coming to vote (edited)

In my opinion it's unnecessary because people will see the final version on the CV with or without the feedback from advice process at the end of the day who makes the proposal it's who put the rules then its up the community if they wanna accept it or not.

ah ok, yeah, so it's not something crazy to ask right

maybe the advice process can be a little more lose, and the actual proposal needs to fit in the template

i misunderstood i though you were suggesting an extra step thats why i said its unecessary, but no in my opinion this is important so people know what they really voting for

Can people make proposals now? And do I understand I need to do that on the forum, I can't do it here?

. I'd love to put up a proposal called "Is your DAO a DAO?"

_23-Oct-21 02:04 AM_:

Thank you! So I've been thinking about the recent really neat simulation, and how EduGaming is becoming much more important, eg for Onboarding and Orientation it could be really awesome. But in this case, I'm thinking about folk in DAOs. I've seen some that are really chaotic, and I wanted to ask a more constructive question in such DAOs, asking whether folk are constructing a better DAO - maybe, How DAO is your DAO? - are they getting a higher simul score, or still have some work to do. It would be a great eval for TEC, for example. So one example of a sliding Param could be dynamism versus organisation. Another could be scale versus focus. Or another, activity versus attentive audience. Another could be team responsibilities versus freedom. I'm not saying these are ideal examples of Params, I'm trying to get a gist across of what I'm thinking. But let's say that each Param slider is an indication to one or more TEC WG, eg there is definitely at least one about community building and governance, say choosing open debate vs defined culture. The above may be a little garbled, but I can see potential for TEC to promote their significant learning to others also wanting to learn, in different areas of DAO formation. Is that making sense? Or do I have rather more work to do to explain, something I know I often need to work on? (And my constant bad habit is trying to run before I can walk!)

Hello everyone! Just want to introduce myself. I've been down the DAO rabbit hole for the last month or and really like what you are building. One of my objectives is use DAOs to get people more politically engaged so they can organize at the local and state level. A little bit about myself: I'm a co-founder of a nonprofit, Move Nevada Forward, that uses sociocratic (S3) governance. Our vision is to create a human-centered economy for all Nevadans. We stemmed from the Andrew Yang campaign so I'm a huge advocate for UBI, Open Primaries + Ranked-Choice Voting, etc. A lot of the principles S3 holds are similar to how you guys run things which I really like. On top of that I have 9 years of experience as a production supervisor so I've been fascinated by the concept of governance for a bit. That's kinda why I'm interested in this group (plus others lol) I will be at the TEC orientation tomorrow and next week's weekly call. Super happy to help in any way I can as I learn more. Cheers!

_14-Nov-21 02:05 AM_:

Thanks for asking! My project involves 5 or 6 Africans needing access to power and the web. Solar panels are the obvious answer, there are several web options where I need to learn more. Once a solution like this is in place, our project leaders can begin to generate local value, and indeed even start paying back investment funds, on a trickle feed basis. So the plan is that everyone benefits. We have specified the SDG monitoring and reporting needed, and there's a process to find and encourage corporate CSR schemes to donate, on a 50 household basis to give real impact for the investment sum. To summarise, this is good for everyone, will take some hard work, but some of the early spade work has been done. I gather the difficulty is in fostering good final mile relationships, and that is the thing I have done with those local African project leaders. They know what is expected of them, and are willing to work with folk in the cloud who want to give back. What I get out of that is primarily personal satisfaction, doing something for others that is worth doing. I'm both willing and able to give back, just hampered a little by lack of personal resources. But I'm a decent networker and team player, and hoping to use those skills to compensate. Hence my interest in DAOs. TEC I see as a leading example, although I've only looked at 4 or 5 so far, and there's at least 130, probably more. I also energised a FB community for two and a bit years, always wanting to get to a collaborative next step, but that community wasn't quite so conducive to collaboration. This was rather odd, given its strong Systems Thinking connection with complicated and complex processes. So DAOs are a next step for me, and with huge potential for reinventing employment altogether. Employment 2.0, which we can also describe as collaborative employment, not hierarchical employment.

That's awesome! My idea is to create the Final-Five Voting DAO. Its mission is to pass FFV in the US by supporting grassroots efforts. The DAO will provide training and resources to local volunteers who participate in these efforts. I'm very interested in using the Commons Stack, along with other tools, since it's aligned with how I want to grow this community. Currently most of the money that is spend on campaigns or nonprofits go to bureaucrats, overhead, paid media, consultants and all types of crooks. The FFV DAO will give donors the opportunity to invest money for a cause they believe in and have a say where that money is spent. At the same, the people who phonebank, canvass, table, give out flyers and do the groundwork will be compensated and have a seat at the table. This will be ideal for young people who have the time and passion but too often aren't compensated fairly. Another objective of the DAO is to become a platform where we train community organizers so they can make an impact in their local elections beyond this policy. The idea is to train so they use our template to organize for other causes. Right now there are several efforts in the US to pass FFV, including Nevada, California, Florida, South Carolina and many others. The problem is that everyone is working in silos. The FFV DAO will allow us to share resources and use our collective intelligence to pass these ballot initiatives much faster. This will also allow others states to learn from us and speed up the process altogether. If the FFV DAO is successful in passing some of these ballot initiatives it will legitimize DAOs and help to mainstream them even further. Everyone in the US can sense that our country is spiraling out of control and we need to make some changes to our current system.

Hello everyone! Just want to introduce myself. I've been down the DAO rabbit hole for the last month or and really like what you are building. One of my objectives is use DAOs to get people more politically engaged so they can organize at the local and state level. A little bit about myself: I'm a co-founder of a nonprofit, Move Nevada Forward, that uses sociocratic (S3) governance. Our vision is to create a human-centered economy for all Nevadans. We stemmed from the Andrew Yang campaign so I'm a huge advocate for UBI, Open Primaries + Ranked-Choice Voting, etc. A lot of the principles S3 holds are similar to how you guys run things which I really like. On top of that I have 9 years of experience as a production supervisor so I've been fascinated by the concept of governance for a bit. That's kinda why I'm interested in this group (plus others lol) I will be at the TEC orientation tomorrow and next week's weekly call. Super happy to help in any way I can as I learn more. Cheers!

I have an idea for this ... Groups of producers in WhatsApp groups share articles, and there is a monthly prize for the most helpful article. I have a WAG corodinators interested already, but need to put some process in place ... Winners are promoted on eg Twitter ... Happy to chat more ...

_23-Nov-21 01:59 PM_:

Today's exercise reminded me of another tool I use called Objectives and Key Results (OKRs). It was popularized by Google in the early 2000s and now used by many companies. Very easy to understand with a little bit of practice. [https://www.whatmatters.com/faqs/okr-meaning-definition-example/](https://www.whatmatters.com/faqs/okr-meaning-definition-example/)

What is an OKR? Definition and Examples

"OKR" stands for "Objectives and Key Results." OKRs are a goal-setting tool for communicating what you want to accomplish and how to measure progress.

Apologies for the mic troubles, but thanks very much for all the thoughtful insights shared, everyone. I still have a lot to delve into exploring Ostrim's work and of course I'm quite new to TEC, but I still very much appreciate today's exercises. The latter one, in particular, can be great for helping to educate newcomers like me about Ostrim's principles and how they underpin the culture of TEC and relate to its day-to-day operations and long-term mission, vision, and goals <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f44c.png" width=20 height=20>

Maybe you can take some comfort from Socrates? He said basically that no one knows everything. A latter day version is "all of us know more than any of us". What is important to be among friends who you know already know this, and where those friends accept that we are all always incomplete. Does this help?

Building on @natesuits sheet, I've started adding in some explanatory categories that might be helpful to give a "at a glance" summary of each set of params. The categories are relative the whole set of proposals.

It's ugly in a spreadsheet but I was going for something like this...

$1 Gambit for $1 Million Goldilocks Orogeny Token Freeze & Thaw: Medium vesting period and floor price support (1-2 yrs) Bonding Curve: Equitable opening price (1-1.5) Medium Common Pool Fund (500K-1M) Low Price Volatility (RR > 25) Low Combined Entry and Exit Tribute (<10) Similar Entry and Exit (< 5pt difference) ‚Ä¶.

i've been testing numbers to the bonding curve and I think now that instead of making a lot of scenarios, maybe doing just one or two would be easier to present in the pamphlet, . One scenario i liked because it presents very different outputs from each proposal was (10 million wxDAI buy + 1 million TEC sell)

<h3>Juankbell <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/749990807238607020/8deaadd14238c0a72a8871176b993946.png" width=25 height=25></h3>

_27-Dec-21 11:32 AM_:
Another good criteria is how much WxDAI is needed to mint the same amount of hatchers tokens, i will be sending the information here <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f642.png" width=20 height=20>

- For 4.20 public open In this proposal, entering 10 million WxDAI into the bonding curve, 422676 new TEC will be minted (that is almost 1/5 of total hatcher's tokens - Meaning that in this scenario, newcomers will have approximately 21% of the hatcher's governance). With these conditions, the price of the token will rise 77%, making it 53.94 WxDAI per TEC. This can make it attractive to hatchers to sell (assuming the vesting period is over), and if 50% of the hatchers sell their tokens (1 million TEC) the price of the token will drop to 0.06 WxDAI. (Lower than the initial price of hatchers and the bonding curve) To mint an approximation of hatcher's TEC Tokens, 10.000.000.000 WxDAI will be needed. (edited)
- For Mathmematics V4 simulation In this proposal, entering 10 million WxDAI into the bonding curve, 1225393 new TEC will be minted (that is almost 6/10 of total hatcher's tokens - Meaning that in this scenario, newcomers will have approximately 61% of the hatcher's governance). With these conditions, the price of the token will rise 79%, making it 19.83 WxDAI per TEC. This can make it attractive to hatchers to sell (assuming the vesting period is over), and if 50% of the hatchers sell their tokens (1 million TEC) the price of the token will drop to 2.81 WxDAI. (Higher than the initial price of both Hatchers and the Bonding curve) To mint an approximation of hatcher's TEC Tokens, 40.000.000 WxDAI will be needed. (edited)
- For Bolcheviks Gambit In this proposal, entering 10 million WxDAI into the bonding curve, 1474667 new TEC will be minted (that is almost 3/4 of total hatcher's tokens - Meaning that in this scenario, newcomers will have approximately 73% of the hatcher's governance). With these conditions, the price of the token will rise 73%, making it 13.92 WxDAI per TEC. This can make it attractive to hatchers to sell (assuming the vesting period is over), and if 50% of the hatchers sell their tokens (1 million TEC) the price of the token will drop to 3.71 WxDAI. (Higher than the initial price of both Hatchers and the Bonding curve) To mint an approximation of hatcher's TEC Tokens, 20.000.000 WxDAI will be needed. (edited)
- For Goldilocks $1 bet for 1 mill In this proposal, entering 10 million WxDAI into the bonding curve, 1442473 new TEC will be minted (that is almost 3/4 of total hatcher's tokens - Meaning that in this scenario, newcomers will have approximately 72% of the hatcher's governance). With these conditions, the price of the token will rise 71%, making it 11.71 WxDAI per TEC. This can make it attractive to hatchers to sell (assuming the vesting period is over), and if 50% of the hatchers sell their tokens (1 million TEC) the price of the token will drop to 3.20 WxDAI. (Higher than the initial price of both Hatchers and the Bonding curve) To mint an approximation of hatcher's TEC Tokens, 20.000.000 WxDAI will be needed.
- For Ostrom‚Äôs 1 million baby In this proposal, entering 10 million WxDAI into the bonding curve, 2036806 new TEC will be minted (that is almost the same of total hatcher's tokens - Meaning that in this scenario, newcomers will have approximately the same amount of the hatcher's governance). With these conditions, the price of the token will rise 74%, making it 9.97 WxDAI per TEC. This can make it attractive to hatchers to sell (assuming the vesting period is over), and if 50% of the hatchers sell their tokens (1 million TEC) the price of the token will drop to 4.07 WxDAI. (Higher than the initial price of both Hatchers and the Bonding curve). To mint an approximation of hatcher's TEC Tokens, 10.000.000 WxDAI will be needed.

And I will respond to it now, since...Education! <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f643.png" width=20 height=20>

Point 4: "Buy $x.xxM FROM the ABC" is a phrase that could work. The term send is being used to acknowledge the fact that most of the BUYS of TEC will more than likely be done on secondary markets and not through the ABC itself. ABC volume will more than likely come from arbitrage.

Point 5: The "Augmented" descriptor of our ABC describes not only the Bonding Curve (wxDAI reserve + mint/burn of TEC), but also the continuous funding of our Common Pool, the embedded Token Freeze & Token Thaw process, and the ABC's link to Conviction Voting. The language is something we want to keep consistent.

awesome! thanks for sharing Chuy!

@natesuits in general I'm just making things bigger and more distributed to be easier to read

hope that's ok

I think we shouldn't be afraid of it being a long document, but one that people feel comfortable reading :)

@griff (üíú, üíú) @chuygarcia.eth @natesuits@Zeptimus @Edu - TEC Steward. I'm leaning towards deleting the explanations of the modules (edited)

and leaving just the one in the glossary

I think its a good point from max chuy

any blocks?

@Stewards @Nuggan it would be great to have everyone in soft gov today - I'm proposing we have a discussion on these 3 topics: incentive alignment - how are proposals aligning TEC 's MVV with financial incentives? Participation - how are proposals addressing governance. Especially number of token holders vs active voters Sustainability - how are proposals addressing the financial sustainability of the TEC and value production

TE flower categories for mapping expertise Once this topics are discussed, the more refined ideas will be brought to the reward system wg since the focus there has been more practical for deploying the dashboard~!

Hey Laurence! Right now the nomination of new stewards is done only by stewards, we don't need unanimous support, just no blocks.

We've been thinking tho to open this process for the community to nominate stewards too but it hasn't been proposed yet

_08-Mar-22 04:11 PM_:

I think it's a really interesting approach and having more basic engagement opportunities is something we've been talking about in Communitas, and it's something I was exploring in the doc I just sent out on that front. I do agree with Livia though that we need to be *super* careful about what stuff like this does to intrinsic motivation and the overall sense of community.

_08-Mar-22 05:05 PM_:

This is something I just came across (again lol), I think is related to some extent to how contributing or entering a DAO feels/looks like (edited)

"The Need to Win When an archer is shooting for nothing He has all his skill. If he shoots for a brass buckle He is already nervous. If he shoots for a prize of gold He goes blind Or sees two targets ‚Äì He is out of his mind. His skill has not changed, But the prize Divides him. He cares, He thinks more of winning Than of shooting ‚Äì And the need to win Drains him of power."




i believe that's from the Zhuangzi

Sounds great, so is this something we can continue working on. Not sure how it proceeds, should we start talking to Stewards about possible tasks? Establish an action plan?

In a comment, @stef ask how Holacracy was different from ideas in the "The TEC and Its People" doc. It'd been a while since I'd dug into Holacracy, so this morning I sat in on a call with them. Here are my notes. I think there are a lot of places where it might align with TEC philosophy, actually:

thanks for sharing it Gideon! I'll take a look at it

hey @natesuits can you share some updates on the advice process pamphlets today?

@liviade I can, although they still need to be worked on. There are still some questions around the use of pamphlets. Others have suggested we simply make graphics (which we already have) and memes to support it. But we can definitely discuss it.

_13-Apr-22 11:20 AM_:

that's interesting - I think the main difference from what I'm reading there is that we don't open this process for the whole community. We've had arguments for both, but the rationale to have this closed to the stewards group is that they have the most insight in the community and also on the role of steward to bring a new person in. Also it doesn't open for bigger conflicts. It's sensitive to have an open nomination where the community could vote someone down and affect this person sense of belonging.

also, we have community stewards that aren't stewards of a working group - they are just stewarding the community in their particular way that is also valuable. We also have working group leads that are not community stewards. Separating this two roles was important for our organization and understanding of responsibilities

Yeah I think my biggest qualm was that since stewards nominate and elect themselves it creates a closed loop of community leaders that doesn't gather community input. Right now I can say we have a good batch of stewards with integrity and good intentions but it's easy to see how this system can devolve into an exclusive club that is vulnerable to personal politics and favouritism. I agree that an open nomination is risky but at least have the community stamp the approval of a new steward

_13-Apr-22 01:53 PM_:

@liviade on the point of % of aligned proposals maybe it‚Äôs better if we measure the effectiveness of the Advice Process? Which i guess directly related to the proposals that end up being proposed

Or measure the outcome of proposals (based also on what we talked about accountability) rather than the input of proposals to the TEC

I‚Äôm not convinced we will ever agree on a hard metric to look at ‚Äúalignment‚Äù nor the effectiveness of that

Thinking about @teresacd's comment on entering, 1Hive is close to getting the MVP of Quests (some sort of bounty board arbitrated by Celeste), maybe that's something worth having in mind to integrate that into the onboarding process and give like X $TEC/WXDAI for easy tasks like recording calls or idk whatever needed and/or that we want to enforce to get people started? @Tam2140 @liviade idk who else may be interested in this

_14-Apr-22 02:45 PM_:

You could have the best of both worlds by setting a threshold number of votes from both stewards and the community. For example, if you want to filter for those who are super qualified you could require a simple majority from stewards and a super majority from the community (e.g. two-thirds).

I was asking Richie from Clarity this very same question but for Sampo. He said: " you don't need to make a new account. bases are owned by a user, but that just decides who can delete the base. we will eventually have a way for a multisig to own a base, so that it's not tied to a single person, but this is best practice right now"

Hello everyone! I was inspired to find my way here after watching the working group video you all shared. I agree with the idea that we are creating the framework for the more empowered and equitable communities/companies! I would love to contribute to the building of this. Not surewhere to start, can I invite myself to the next meeting and be assigned some homework to do in anticipation of that meeting?

Such a bummer this meeting is at the same time that I do some bonding and movement with my team mates. I think about cloning myself at least once a week just because of this overlap. I'm really liking the counter culture aspect being spoken to. I haven't been able to add any assets to the soft gov clarity thing.

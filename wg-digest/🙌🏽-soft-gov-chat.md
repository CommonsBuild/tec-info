_06-Oct-20 02:16 PM_:	Some notes on the #onboarding experiment:
- I'd offer to start with onboarding calls on Thursday 6pm CEST, for the next 3 weeks
- everyone, feel free to offer an own slot!

Goal:
- Providing an overview on the TE Community
- How to get active
- Point them to TE Commons, and how to get active
PLUS:
- why they've joined TE Community
- what they are looking for
- what they might be able to contribute

Ideal outcome:
- people find their way to get active
- we collect and share learnings about our community members, missing information, soft governance needs etc

Hello Livia and everyone! I've been trying to ground some ideas and this is what I want to present for consideration.
-> For the 13th Oct - Ask for review:
Draft for a conflict resolution program Inside Decentralized organizations
1. We could have training courses x  times a year. that rewards NFTs.
2. People who pass the training and show they have soft skills and understanding of conflict can become part of this trusted group of conflict management supporters for the organization. 
3. That will provide the minimum requirements, but then we need to develop a reputation system to promote meritocracy and good will.
4. Agreements are hashed in the blockchain, associated to a smart contract with KPi‚Äôs to ensure accountability.
5. What type of conflicts will they be able to manage? Mostly conflict between members and non consensual situations.
6. This is a voluntary process that can be called by one or both parts, but to proceed there should be willingness to address the issue by all parts involved.
7. The conflict management process does not end on the potencial agreement. After it, there should be KPI‚Äôs associated to a smart contract and an off-chain follow-up.
8. Requesting this services should have a cost (even if it‚Äôs low) - Conflict management should be economically productive for conflict resolution supporters. - recognition of labor.
&#191;Could it be part/requirement of the deal for being a community steward ? (re @liviade: also, @Santigs67 and @JuankBell let me know if you need anything in regards to the wiki and conflict resolution)

_13-Oct-20 02:16 PM_:	Hey nice to meet you all!

I feel the conversation around accountability meandered a bit, and zoomed in more around possible incentive mechanisms - which of course are extremely important, but might not cover the entire picture. So I'll share some thoughts in here..

First, I think it's important to distinguish distinct scenarios, while an effort isn't followed through to conclusion. Reasons I can see:

* Lack of consistency, interrupted focus
--> This is an operational concern, and thus it would need to be addressed in a static manner, in terms of finding a setup/structure which returns the focus back to the effort, so that the process can advanced and doesn't just get dropped or started over
(I'm starting with this one, not because it is necessarily the most important one, but perhaps the most personal one...I tend to have very widespread interest, so I constantly need to find ways to return focus and sustain progression)

[I will in general assume that motivations are sincere and internally driven, as in Scrum where you assume best effort. If there is an issue on the level of motivation, then you face completely different problems, but I consider this to be less of an issue in the case of volountary projects]

* Motivations have changed 
--> This is possible, and there I believe its important that this requires some kind of feedback system. Its ok when the objective changes and an effort is no longer pursued, but then it needs to be flagged or communicated so that others know that the process is suspended.

* Priorities have changed (something more important has come up)
--> This is where performance breaks down when stress is applied. The moment the pressure increases, all sorts of urgent things cut in at the front of the queue, often interrupting important efforts. If this becomes an issue, we need to find some sort of priority management, like allocate fixed time slots to deal with urgent tasks and spend the rest on the important ones, so that they progress.

So without knowing to many specifics, I suspect it will be more likely in the area where people's attention wanders, so it requires structures which easily guide them back to pursue the important tasks and gain ground on what is relevant.

For loss or change of motivations we'd require some feedback loops, so that tasks can be handed over, and aren't just simply dropped. (If you volounteer to be accountable for something, that should remain with you until you passed it on to someone else, so people are entitled to keep bugging you...that could be one option)

If priority queues escalate, it might require some process to manage those and shield the important efforts from being interrupted (but I can't asses if this is a concern, based on what I've seen so far)

Lastly, its possible that people over-commit, or do favours for others, and then the task doesn't enjoy the attention it deserves. Here we need to be sincere in our commitments, while of course someone has to do the house-keeping, so if unpopular tasks arise, perhaps we can find structure to share the load, or do things together (that always helps me - if its pleasant to do something together, it matters much less whether you like what you do or not, for me)

These are just what stood out from the top of my mind, as it doesn't seem to me that people defect, so penalties might be unwarranted for, but its perfectly reasonable to point out to people if there is a cost associated when tasks are not achieved in time. (if they result in downstream delays &amp; repercussions in particular)

In general I will always favour positive incentives, as prospected bounties, are rewards based on contribution and accomplishment over negative ones (penalties), but its possible that the latter ones could be necessary in the future for certain operational concern where failure might result in an actual cost. But that should not be the motivation, its more like Hammurabi's law: if your actions cause damage, its unhealthy to be entrely

shielded from it. (this is more when people can make decisions which involve risks, so I don't think thats very likely throughout the build-phase)

-----------------------
Now in the intro I briefly shared my interest &amp; focus with regards to Meta-Ethics &amp; Ethical Modes of Reasoning.

My involvement with this field was the principal reason why this group was suggested to me. Now I know this has been going on as a development process way before our encounter. So I will hold back to not derail any active processes, but I can provide a brief overview over my background &amp; involvement in this:

The question of ethics quickly goes back to the question of 'how do you distinguish better ethics from lesser ethics?' and there is really no simple way to resolve this question.

-> The solution to me, seems to find the most general interface, which is universally applicable and can facilitate a dialogue among a multitude of people who hold different values. In my opinion, a framework for ethical reasoning needs to meet the standard to be invariant under any possible choice of ethics, deal with the superset of all possible configurations.

- The most universal approch I have found has been developed by Ralph Potter at Harvard, who was a protege of Talcott Parsons. 
- Parsons did an inductive study over 10s of thousands of people and observed how their opinions would cluster together, to identify similarities in their world views
- Potter identified the most basic assumptions which resulted in the observed clustering

-> of course people are perfectly capable to hold all sorts of incoherent opinions and contradictory believes, but in their analysis they discovered that those who were internally and self-referentially consistent (i.e. systemic) in their thinking, achieved this by adhering to a particular principle.
-> when that principle was applied to everyday question throughout the world, it would generate consistent answers, which gave rise to a philosophy (&#161;this is where philosophy comes from!)
-> this principle is called the 'Ethical Mode of Reasoning' and there aren't that many of them.

This was bought to me by Danny Sheehan, in my opinion one of the heaviest attorneys on the planet, with over 50 years of legal experience as a constitutional trial lawyer...so he's intimately familiar with real world scenarios of conflicts and how they can be resolved, and what the pitfalls are, how regulatory frameworks are easily misused, when the laws are re-interpreted from the perspective generated by another principle, than the one from which it was originally stated.

All of this is deeply investigated in the context of Natural Law, which was thought by Rev. John Witherspoon at the College of New Jersey (today Princeton), who thought a course on Moral Philosophy during formation of the original articles of confederation - and how it stands in stark contrast with how the legal mechanisms are implemented, applied and interpreted today.

Now I'm not suggesting to recreate the same framework, but as it has served as a blue-print for western civilization, I find its quite valuable to understand its merits as well as its pit-falls - yet my interests go more directly to the heart of moral philosophy and the entire spectrum of world views, which I consider the optimal starting point for any kind of regulatory &amp; governing system, including its application in the context of dispute resolutions.

If this seems interesting to you, you'd like to know more, or would enjoy a discussion about any of it, or approaches to ethics in general, don't hesitate to reach out to me, I am deeply passionate about this subject and it is very dear to me. If you feel it is useful in any way, you will enjoy my full support, but I will not push for any of it, as I do not want to get in the way of any ongoing processes or efforts that I might not be aware of.

Best, Fabian
---------------------------------

oh, maybe I should add...

Natural Law philosophy is the basis of what we know as consensus..

or how it appears in John Rawls 'Theory of Justice' as 'the intuitionists'

-> Rawls set out in his thesis that a community will always select the option which results in the biggest good for the largest number of people (traditional 'majoritarian utilitarian' mode of decisions making), but he realized that that wasn't always the case, as he couldn't explain things why 90% of the white people wouldn't still own 10% of the black people, or why people would choose to do something for handicapped, for example paraplegic people, as in bot cases it couldn't be explained by applying a utilitarian perspective
-> so he realized that there was another principle operative, which he called that the group would select the option which would generate the biggest good for the largest number of people _while_ still doing at least something for the ones which were the least well off. And he called this group 'the intuitionists' which essentially traces the characteristics for consensus, and is consistent with Natural Law, going back to the Scottish Enlightenment.
(just as some background)

_13-Oct-20 03:28 PM_:	Thank you Fabian! Think it's amazing to have this group of multidisciplinary experts working towards addressing very fundamental issues that are complex in all kind of social structures, but even more in decentralized ones. 
Share this paragraph of L. Wittgenstein that represents what drives me participating here:

"We can easily imagine people amusing themselves in a field by
playing with a ball so as to start various existing games, but playing
many without finishing them and in between throwing the ball aimlessly into the air, chasing one another with the ball and bombarding
one another for a joke and so on."

I think in this group we can think collectively on how can we improve this "ball game" we humans are playing.

Amongst other issues, we are researching and brainstorming on conflict management models inside decentralized organizations. Would love to chat with you on this. I suggest to make an open call for that topic on Mondays.

_14-Oct-20 01:52 PM_:	[telegram] I have to ask a question, why do we call it "soft" governance? It feels like a derogatory term.

[telegram] liviade in my opinion it is harder to touch on culture, and the nature of the relationships are more flexible, rather than a vote that gives a yes or no answer and the nature of the contracts that are based on "immutable code"

[telegram] liviade I think most of the space agrees at this point that soft gov is as important as hard gov, and actually the foundation that makes everything work

@bridge-bot there is always the tension between agency (performing tasks on behalf of another) and autonomy (being free to pick how to do task). For DAOs' it can be hard to transition from a relatively flat development / open-source style to a traditional hierarchical firm ... see MakerDAO for example of conflict and the messy outcome

_15-Oct-20 07:38 AM_:	[telegram] akrtws Exactly. And I wouldn't call it a "later transition". Look at todays DAOs, 1Hive, Metagame, CommonsStack, and even TE Commons right now. There is a layer of people who are driving it, and who are committed to sort out issues, whatever it might take. You might call it a founding team, community stewards whatever.
In most cases, they are a) funded, and b) weren't elected or assigned to this role by community vote.

_15-Oct-20 09:53 AM_:	[telegram] Have a nice day! In Colombia we have an "aspirational" constitution. That means everything that's written there is a shared goal but it's achievement is not a fixed reality. I think I understand Elad's point in this but a beautiful thing about all this projects are the possibility of experimentation, and if until now we haven't been able to solve some questions, that doesn't mean we should go back to what we are trying to evolve from. I'm not saying that we shouldn't rely on decentralized systems governance, but also focus on strengthening the social structures behind them. In my opinion, this systems require a social approach that is being identified in the agenda and needs to try to answer very philosophical topics, like how do you show a person that's cozy in his cave that there is sunlight outside, how do you make everyone capable of taking decisions without external influence, and how do we use technologies for addressing human needs. 
Besides, how can we make humans collaborate, how can we make fair trades, how can we not-discriminate, how can we improve existing power structures.

_16-Oct-20 03:51 AM_:	[telegram] It is useful to have leaders with roles and delegated decision making power. Obviously, it depends on the nature and the needs of the DAO, but it does make sense to role-based authority which may rotate periodically. I find it extremely difficult to answer theoretical questions because everything depends on the specific application.
The other thing I would say about a DAO is that people are not clear about the nature of what it is. If you envision a DAO as circles of groups, each of which is doing an autonomous thing and then that they come together to do another thing, the idea of someone leading the organization is a bit unclear. I see the DAO configuration a project-oriented configuration. A bunch of working groups might get together to do a project. For that project, there would be a coordinator and that coordinator might have some very specific powers for the course of that project.
The idea of organizations and businesses as entities with a life of their own feels outdated to me. I think we are seeing this in our community as well. Different organizations pull us at different times. Right now it's TE and CC, but last year it was more dGov and Genesis. Same group, but those projects completed or faded and now we are the same people doing the next project. Leaders are moving among the projects that move them as the movement progresses.

In that way, we don't need branding and long-term organizations, but we do need reputation among us, as in, who is good at what. I think we're doing a generally crappy job at tracking who contributed what and who was good or bad at it, but we are still small enough to know those things in our head, sort of. It's one of the frustrating problems of being a professional. You may be very good at what you do, but if you don't "market' it properly, then it doesn't count as a contribution.

_16-Oct-20 09:42 AM_:	[telegram] JuankBell I think the idea of working towards rotation is key in communities. Once we begin something, -if we like it- we always aspire to have an improvement of conditions (responsibilities, economical, reputation). It is a way to empower new members and promote different learning experiences for each participant. Maybe if rotation between project leaders is high -going to new projects- we can take that as a positive input towards decentralization, in a way that we need to have more people capable of assuming leaderships and promote project resilience.

_16-Oct-20 12:36 PM_:	[telegram] catching up on this now - I don't resonate with his perspective. He is actually presuming that an external Leviathan or internal centralized and non fully transparent structure is necessary to avoid the tragedie of the commons which is the same premisse that puts natural resource systems in the hands of central governments (re @akrtws: Sharing a thread here - Make sure you read the whole thread including Ameen's and Gabriel Shapiro's comments.

this is something Ostrom mentions in her book about the dangers of seeing the Leviathan as the only way (re @liviade: catching up on this now - I don't resonate with his perspective. He is actually presuming that an external Leviathan or internal centralized and non fully transparent structure is necessary to avoid the tragedie of the commons which is the same premisse that puts natural resource systems in the hands of central governments)

very interesting point that organizations don't have a life of their own but are the product of a certain combination of people. Maybe the nature of the project shapes the nature of the relationships happening there and the whole of it is the "organism" that will be always evolving and reshaping itself (re @GraceRachmany: It is useful to have leaders with roles and delegated decision making power.)

[telegram] liviade maybe we are doing a bad job at communicating the rewards and there is for sure so much room for improvement there. you were in 23rd place in the reward board last month for your inputs you gave in the meeting you joined :) (re @GraceRachmany: In that way, we don't need branding and long-term organizations, but we do need reputation among us, as in, who is good at what. I think we're doing a generally crappy job at tracking who contributed what and who was good or bad at it, but we are still small enough to know those things in our head, sort of. It's one of the frustrating problems of being a professional. You may be very good at what you do, but if you don't "market' it properly, then it doesn't count as a contribution.)

_16-Oct-20 02:09 PM_:	[telegram] This is exactly the problem with "no leadership." I couldn't get clarity on the level of interest or budget, and I didn't feel comfortable "campaigning" the group as an outside expert. 

I don't think of myself as a member of the group so much as an outside expert. Campaigning the group to accept my proposal feels like alien interference.  If the group clearly identified a need and had a call for proposals, that could be helpful.  Otherwise, it feels a bit sleazy to me

If someone in a "leadership" position had said to me "Wow! This is great! I really want to hear more about this! I really want you to join and bring this forward!", then I would have been willing to invest more time.

I guess, for me, it was a question of prioritizing what people are enthusiastic about. That feels more "in flow" with the spirit of the DAO. If nobody is excited, then it feels sleazy. If people are excited, it feels congruent with the group. Does that make sense?

### [telegram] liviade 
Yeah, it does make sense, but to know if people are excited about it, you have to give the chance for people to look at it. That's where I don't see how approaching a "leader" would be more effective than approaching the community as a whole. And I think that's the decentralized culture we are trying to create

_16-Oct-20 05:24 PM_: right! Do you think community stewards could be considered the executive roles? we could start by improving them perhaps. I think having a structure that supports rotative roles are really important like @JuankBell said. 

### akrtws
Actually, here I'm refering to TE Commons once launched. 
Not set in stone that we need any executive role, imho. I'd suggest to take a look at upcoming results in Onboarding. 
Stakeholders > value flows > interactions > policies/roles - and then check again on executive roles.

akrtwsFor the TE Commons build phase: yes, there's always room for improvement, including rotation.
Community stewards considered the executive role? Not sure, depends on how you define "executive role" üòÖ

_16-Oct-20 07:55 PM_:	I also would love to see this document. I have been involved since August and don't remember hearing about this. I think at that time, it was not nearly as organized as it is now, because the organization processes were being built. 
Please feel free to share here, if you are willing - or to the general channel and if it fits a need or some community members are excited, we can have a look at what that could mean. And if it is filling a need, or if this would be after the token a launch, a public good that could be valued via tokens (which thanks to the bonding curve, you could cash out for fiat as I know you don't love more tokens haha).. 
The tracking/rewards mechanism we have now "Praise" seems to capture the work quite well so far, however, if anyone feels they have not been acknowledged, definitely important to voice it, so we can do something about it. We want to honor everyone's work, and I can relate as well in the past, at feeling sometimes having done work, and it not being compensated or recognized, so we definitely want to maintain this intention in the community, and keep looking at processes and make sure they are inclusive. (re @GraceRachmany: Right, and I wrote a 4-page document for the TE commons project to create workshops, and offered a free 90-minute workshop.

It's not a status thing, but it's useful to note how hard it is to record everything that's going on.)

I think rather than executive, leadership in this context is more about taking responsibility haha maybe we call them responsibility roles ‚Äî ya know, the people who clean up after the party lol (re @akrtws: Actually, here I'm refering to TE Commons once launched.

_19-Oct-20 02:09 PM_:	[telegram] @GraceRachmany  welcome!! So, I think I need to clarify this --> I had asked for a rough "quote" of what you would need to pull this off, and we have documented it (but normally if you do a quote and offer a 90 min free workshop) I wouldn't agree to account for any hours in that --> and in general this is what I don't like about praise because everyone learns at some time "oh, that actually is a spread sheet, and I need to increase the number of hours in there" --> hence I asked you (and I know you don't operate like that --> but basically an transformation that is created by an hours accounting environments) and others to join as Subject Matter Experts to Working Group 0 [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GZi7Cz0DlovZBRzocxfj-5A9Jp3lGX6kjFxoTH8v2G4/edit#](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GZi7Cz0DlovZBRzocxfj-5A9Jp3lGX6kjFxoTH8v2G4/edit#) that proposal is currently on rework - as I realized that we will not be able to scale this with workshops alone; and it is quite a big undertaking;

[Proposal Working Group 0: Towards Computer-aided Governance](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GZi7Cz0DlovZBRzocxfj-5A9Jp3lGX6kjFxoTH8v2G4/edit)

so there is a group working on improving the proposal (we don't account hours - but when we're ready, the impact of it will be appreciated, here and elsewhere (fractal ownership!) ) but to be fair, I must really mention this --> I don't account for mine or anyone elses hours who work with me on sth. instead I look for ways to make these accessible to a wide and diverse network (which I have, and most of the people I work with do) --> so it is more commons-based peer production, you can own the results of our co-creation and monetize, and our networks are also open to do so farther than in any single one... All we ask from collaborators is account for impact <-- this is not TEC culture, it's a subculture if you will

_20-Oct-20 10:49 AM_:	JuankBellI used the analogy with sports for graduated sanctions. To keep the pace of the game when unwanted behavior happens, there are clear penalties to easily address common issues and keep playing without much traumatism. First there can be verbal warnings, then there could be yellow cards, whose accumulation would mean a red card and loosing privilegies for a period of time.

JuankBellif the sanctioned does not agree with the sanction, he can present a counterargument that would lead to a negotiation process with an SME

JuankBellThe players should recognice when they receive a yellow card in order for it to be legitimate.

_20-Oct-20 01:30 PM_:	Hii. Great to be here. Thanks for the invite. 
On this point I really think learnings from the 'Catalyst' Roles at Enspiral could be a lot of help. 
2 paid rotating roles (1-2 years) in a community of 140 who 'hold the context of the whole' and direct people to the right places, make connections, ensure things don't fall through the cracks (without being responsible for doing all the work). Our Catalysts are 'leaders in the form of stewards' of the network without being 'the exec' or bosses. My 2 cents : most important skill for this role is to really being able to Listen (re @liviade: right! Do you think community stewards could be considered the executive roles? we could start by improving them perhaps. I think having a structure that supports rotative roles are really important like @JuankBell said.)

So when you vote you are taking tokens that arent part of the conviction math yet and adding them to the "effective supply" which actually increases the conviction requirements for all proposals. 
And when you vote in Conviction Voting, your voting power takes time to accumulate

_03-Nov-20 06:46 AM_:	Interesting developments on topic of 'conflict resolution' (is this the right channel?) Not just because its a fork but its seems particularly nasty and is around topic of devs getting paid...

The reason why the community heats up is that the Bitcoin ABC development team is asking the miners to share 8% of the revenue with the coding team. According to the ABC announcement, 90% of the developer‚Äôs time goes to supporting BCH with the most secure code possible. Since the team cannot work for free forever, they have decided to change the core consensus rules.
> 
Per the Infrastructure Funding Proposal (IFP), 8% of the miner‚Äôs block rewards will go towards the addresses of ABC developers. They are going to put the funds in place to keep making the BCH network a competing project. The funds will go to BCH community members, as well as to the team.
> 
A number of notable BCH community members place votes against the ABC plan. They blame the development team for asking too much money. They mention ‚Äúharmful attempt to split‚Äù the community, yet others praise the ABC team for incoming free money.

_06-Nov-20 01:36 PM_:	Yes, it was an incredibly effective system.

I think they still have it going, you would have to get in touch with them. The person who engineered the system has gone on to other projects but I am pretty sure they still use it. It was a company of about 80 people and there were numerous academics who studied it and said that they could not identify points of decision-making because it was so fluid, like a living system. So, for example, if a product manager had an idea from a customer, that PM would announce it and people would respond and give input on the Slack channel and slowly people would gather around the project to do an MVP to show to a client and get client feedback, then if it was successful, more engineers would join the project and release it as a full feature. There wasn't some "decision". "It was more like a gathering around good ideas. 
For applicants to a job at Satalia, they had a Trello board of things that were small projects that could be done. The person would choose something from the board and get it done (with the right access to people at the company,etc.). No job interview. You either got the tasl done and proved you were good or not.

GraceRachmanyFor deciding on pay, everyone's salary was transparent and they had charts where you could see people's contributions to code, to Slack, etc. You could look at the person's contributions relative to the average in the company, average on team, etc. Everyone would vote whether they thought the person deserved the salary upgrade they were asking for. Sometimes people got a bigger upgrade than they even asked for based on the voting.

_01-Dec-20 11:08 PM_:	Hi everyone, thanks for your dedication on calls today. I want to highlight some of the notes that were captured by the recording team in todays Softgov WG:

27:00 - What are the stocks, flows, units, and resources that we have available in TEC?

The people, the token, the energy, the intention that we share. Awareness of where we put our attention. 

‚ÄúHuman resources‚Äù vs. Knowledge, skills, abilities.The flow is the skills that we all contribute.

The commons becomes the ability to orchestrate the skills and abilities of everyone coming together, but focusing on the potentialities of what we can all do together.  The stock is the community, the intellectual capital that we bring to this effort.  The flow is the world that we are living in in six months. And what does the world look like in 2022 and beyond.

‚ÄòValue of use‚Äô and ‚ÄòValue of exchange‚Äô - Our stock is the value that comes from the usage of the knowledge that we all bring. It may not yet be as profitable as we value it, but the exchange flow will be unlocked over time with the TEC tokens. We are creating value and giving it an exchange value by utilizing the knowledge we have through the technology mechanisms that we are producing. This is what makes our network regenerative. We are providing knowledge on how we can gather and manage funds towards token engineering products. We are all making the structure for these products to be regenerative. The soft-value will be reflected in the value of the token.

Consider the 8 forms of wealth from hinduism.

Happy Token Engineering! SO MUCH PRAISE TO EVERYONE FLOWING TODAY SUCH GOODNESS - YGG

_14-Jan-21 04:56 PM_:	Heyy team!! So, the first TEST CRED distribution happened on our sourcecred implementation, you can give it a check in here [https://tecommons.github.io/tec-sourcecred/#/accounts](https://tecommons.github.io/tec-sourcecred/#/accounts)  ü•≥

A favor I want to ask is that if you don't find your account in the list, please let me know. This first distribution is to test and play around, see if the weight and values are being accurate. Next call we can all discuss around it üåû

kudos to @sandpiper to helping this happen

_26-Jan-21 01:27 PM_:	I would say that an expansion on Ostrom's Principles around "rules' is that the "rules" we are deciding on are a social contract that unifies the strategies we're all taking to try to get our needs met. I prefer to think of "rules" as "guidelines" when I have a problem with the "enforcement" side of this and to think of "guidelines" as "rules" when I don't really feel like they don't apply to me in the context of a group.

Another word for "guidelines" could also be "expectations"

> Canadian-American filmmaker and writer Astra Taylor admits that for most of her life the term "democracy" held little appeal. But when she took on the what-is-democracy question, her inquiry turned into a belief that while it may not fully exist, democracy is still worth fighting for.

More than this, trust sustains transparency and vulnerability in expression and in asking for help and so on, since we don't exist in a zero sum game.

And why we should be focused on trust far more than conflict resolution

_26-Jan-21 04:50 PM_:	JuankBell I think trust creation is transversal to the whole project, and something we are issuing in all the working groups. And specifically soft gov, transparency, legal and Gravity we are trying to prevent / manage conflicts, understanding that to be able of managing conflict is an important component of trust.

trust in a system that can overcome and solve its own issues

You click on show weight configuration and play around with the numbers. Our document is supposed to make it easier to understand but anyone can start giving feedback already.

_02-Feb-21 01:55 PM_:	 Rigidity: (ranging from adaptive to immutable): refers to the level of flexibility of a DAO to react and adapt to occurrences within the system that might require a change to the system rules, such as a DAO protocol upgrade. It reflects the level of ‚Äúactive‚Äù democracy (‚Äúdemocracyness‚Äù) and represents the strength of the feedback loop of how much an individual agent can actually shape the co-steering of the system. In the parlance introduced above, systems that exhibit strong democracyness have a strong A2I feedback loop (as opposed to a strong I2A feedback loop, which is far more common in most organizations). One end of the spectrum presents institutions more difficult to change, and the other end of the spectrum are systems that are more adaptive to the stated needs of their participants.

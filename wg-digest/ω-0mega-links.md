- [Standards for Mathematical Practice - Common Core State Standards Initiative](http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Practice)
  > The Standards for Mathematical Practice describe varieties of expertise that mathematics educators at all levels should seek to develop in their students. These practices rest on important “processes and proficiencies” with longstanding importance in mathematics education. The first of these are the NCTM process standards of problem solving, reasoning and proof, communication, representation, and connections. The second are the strands of mathematical proficiency specified in the National Research Council’s report Adding It Up : adaptive reasoning, strategic competence, conceptual understanding (comprehension of mathematical concepts, operations and relations), procedural fluency (skill in carrying out procedures flexibly, accurately, efficiently and appropriately), and productive disposition (habitual inclination to see mathematics as sensible, useful, and worthwhile, coupled with a belief in diligence and one’s own efficacy).

  > Institutions are structured around an extitutional core that always escapes them. Extitutions are figures which have an ambiguous, destabilised and sometimes threatening quality. The central problem that institutional workers face is dealing with and ultimately capturing these extitutions. I look at two ways that institutions have sought to deal with extitutions – through attempts to discipline them or through more recent attempts to control them. I suggest that the generalised crisis of institutions may involve this passage from disciplining extitutions to controlling them.

  > Contextual intelligence is about expanding our understanding of – and capacity to address – the contexts shaping the situations we face. It’s also about how context influences our ability to actually do that. Ideally we’d be in contexts, conversations, societies that help us transcend our individual and shared assumptions and blind spots so that we can more clearly see the Big Picture we’re immersed in. To the extent we can do that, we’ll be wise and co-intelligent. There are things we can do to increase that capacity – but even just knowing that such an intelligence exists helps us pay attention to what’s important.
- [Creative Participation of the Whole – a North Star concept – Random Communications from an Evolutionary Edge](http://www.tomatleeblog.com/archives/175328462)
  > What does it mean to engage the creative participation of the whole? That aspiration is both simpler and more complex than it may at first seem. Although as an ideal, we can never fully achieve it, every sincere effort in that direction moves us towards a wise democracy and teaches us more about how to better engage the whole. That can be our goal in virtually every undertaking, and it looks different each time.

  > In 2001, Richard Delgado and Jean Stefancic published their definitive Critical Race Theory, a compact introduction to the field that explained, in straightforward language, the origins, principal themes, leading voices, and new directions of this important movement in legal thought. Since then, critical race theory has gone on to influence numerous other fields of scholarship, and the Delgado and Stefancic primer has remained an indispensible guide for students and teachers.Delgado and Stefancic have revised the book to include material on key issues such as colorblind jurisprudence, Latino-Critical scholarship, immigration, and the rollback of affirmative action. This second edition introduces readers to important new voices in fields outside of law, including education and psychology, and offers greatly expanded issues for discussion, updated reading lists, and an extensive glossary of terms.
- [Faces At The Bottom Of The Well](https://books.google.com/books/about/Faces_At_The_Bottom_Of_The_Well.html?id=Tyn1BgAAQBAJ)
  > The classic work on American racism and the struggle for racial justiceIn Faces at the Bottom of the Well, civil rights activist and legal scholar Derrick Bell uses allegory and historical example to argue that racism is an integral and permanent part of American society. African American struggles for equality are doomed to fail so long as the majority of whites do not see their own well-being threatened by the status quo. Bell calls on African Americans to face up to this unhappy truth and abandon a misplaced faith in inevitable progress. Only then will blacks, and those whites who join with them, be in a position to create viable strategies to alleviate the burdens of racism. "Freed of the stifling rigidity of relying unthinkingly on the slogan 'we shall overcome,'" he writes, "we are impelled both to live each day more fully and to examine critically the actual effectiveness of traditional civil rights remedies."Faces at the Bottom of the Well is urgent and essential reading on the problem of racism in America.

  > What comes to mind when you hear the word “koan”? You probably know koans as paradoxes, and you may believe that they are therefore illogical or intellectually inscrutable—and therefore not useful to the average person. Zen Koans: Paradoxical Awakenings is the tool you need to correct your perceptions of koans and become aware of the benefits of koan practice. Embracing the paradox of the koan can give deeper meaning to life, as well as leading to the Buddhist awakening to your real, non-dual nature. With an experienced Zen teacher as your guide, you can enter more deeply into the three essentials of Zen: great faith, great doubt, and great determination.

  > The rapidly growing capabilities and increasing presence of AI-based systems in our lives raise pressing questions about the impact, governance, ethics, and accountability of these technologies around the world. How can we narrow the knowledge gap between AI “experts” and the variety of people who use, interact with, and are impacted by these technologies? How do we harness the potential of AI systems while ensuring that they do not exacerbate existing inequalities and biases, or even create new ones? At the Berkman Klein Center, a wide range of research projects, community members, programs, and perspectives seek to address the big questions related to the ethics and governance of AI. Our first two and half years of work in this area are reviewed in "5 Key Areas of Impact," and a selection of work from across our community is found below.

  > Actor–network theory ( ANT ) is a theoretical and methodological approach to social theory where everything in the social and natural worlds exists in constantly shifting networks of relationships. It posits that nothing exists outside those relationships. All the factors involved in a social situation are on the same level, and thus there are no external social forces beyond what and how the network participants interact at present. Thus, objects, ideas, processes, and any other relevant factors are seen as just as important in creating social situations as humans.

  > In philosophy, ethical dilemmas , also called ethical paradoxes or moral dilemmas , are situations in which an agent stands under two (or more) conflicting moral requirements , none of which overrides the other. A closely related definition characterizes ethical dilemmas as situations in which every available choice is wrong. The term is also used in a wider sense in everyday language to refer to ethical conflicts that may be resolvable, to psychologically difficult choices or to other types of difficult ethical problems. This article is about ethical dilemmas in the strict philosophical sense , often referred to as genuine ethical dilemmas . Various examples have been proposed but there is disagreement as to whether these constitute genuine or merely apparent ethical dilemmas. The central debate around ethical dilemmas concerns the question of whether there are any. Defenders often point to apparent examples while their opponents usually aim to show their existence contradicts very fundamental ethical principles. Ethical dilemmas come in various types. An important distinction concerns the difference between epistemic dilemmas , which give a possibly false impression to the agent of an unresolvable conflict, and actual or ontological dilemmas . There is broad agreement that there are epistemic dilemmas but the main interest in ethical dilemmas takes place on the ontological level. Traditionally, philosophers held that it is a requirement for good moral theories to be free from ethical dilemmas. But this assumption has been questioned in contemporary philosophy.

- [Focus group - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_group)
  > A focus group is a group interview involving a small number of demographically similar people or participants who have other common traits/experiences. Their reactions to specific researcher/evaluator-posed questions are studied. Focus groups are used in market research to understand better people's reactions to products or services or participants' perceptions of shared experiences. The discussions can be guided or open. In market research, focus groups can explore a group's response to a new product or service. As a program evaluation tool, they can elicit lessons learned and recommendations for performance improvement. The idea is for the researcher to understand participants' reactions. If group members are representative of a larger population, those reactions may be expected to reflect the views of that larger population. [1] [2] [3] Thus, focus groups constitute a research or evaluation method that researchers organize to collect qualitative data through interactive and directed discussions. [4]
- [Gödel's incompleteness theorems - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems)
  > Gödel's incompleteness theorems are two theorems of mathematical logic that are concerned with the limits of provability in formal axiomatic theories. These results, published by Kurt Gödel in 1931, are important both in mathematical logic and in the philosophy of mathematics . The theorems are widely, but not universally, interpreted as showing that Hilbert's program to find a complete and consistent set of axioms for all mathematics is impossible.
- [Goal setting - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_setting#Unethical_behavior)
  > Goal setting involves the development of an action plan designed in order to motivate and guide a person or group toward a goal . [1] Goals are more deliberate than desires and momentary intentions. Therefore, setting goals means that a person has committed thought, emotion, and behavior towards attaining the goal. In doing so, the goal setter has established a desired future state which differs from their current state thus creating a mismatch which in turn spurs future actions. [2] Goal setting can be guided by goal-setting criteria (or rules) such as SMART criteria . [3] Goal setting is a major component of personal-development and management literature. Studies by Edwin A. Locke and his colleagues, most notably, [4] have shown that more specific and ambitious goals lead to more performance improvement than easy or general goals. The goals should be specific, time constrained and difficult. Vague goals reduce limited attention resources. Unrealistically short time limits intensify the difficulty of the goal outside the intentional level and disproportionate time limits are not encouraging. [5] Difficult goals should be set ideally at the 90th percentile of performance [ citation needed ] assuming that motivation and not ability is limiting attainment of that level of performance. [6] As long as the person accepts the goal, has the ability to attain it, and does not have conflicting goals, there is a positive linear relationship between goal difficulty and task performance.

- [Motivation - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivation#Practical_applications)
  > Motivation is what explains why people or animals initiate, continue or terminate a certain behavior at a particular time. Motivational states are commonly understood as forces acting within the agent that create a disposition to engage in goal-directed behavior. It is often held that different mental states compete with each other and that only the strongest state determines behavior. [1] This means that we can be motivated to do something without actually doing it. The paradigmatic mental state providing motivation is desire . But various other states, such as beliefs about what one ought to do or intentions , may also provide motivation. Motivation is derived from the word 'motive,' which denotes a person's needs, desires, wants, or urges. It is the process of motivating individuals to take action in order to achieve a goal. The psychological elements fueling people's behavior in the context of job goals might include a desire for money.

The deployment of necropolitics creates what Achille Mbembe calls deathworlds , or "new and unique forms of social existence in which vast populations are subjected to living conditions that confer upon them the status of the living dead." [1] Mbembe, author of On the Postcolony , was the first scholar to explore the term in depth in his 2003 article, [2] and later, his 2019 book of the same name. [1] Mbembe identifies racism as a prime driver of necropolitics, stating that racialized people's lives are systemically cheapened and habituated to loss. [1]

However, unlike the game theory concept, zero-sum thinking refers to a psychological construct —a person's subjective interpretation of a situation.

The essay is as valuable today as when it was first published in 1939. Below an excerpt.

  > Listen to this episode from The Blockchain Socialist on Spotify. For this week's episode I spoke to Ori Shimony (@orishim), co-founder of dOrg, a full-stack Web3 development collective. dOrg is incredibly interesting because it is run similarly to a worker-owned cooperative but functions as a DAO while also being at the forefront of building some of the most cutting-edge crypto platforms and products. During the interview we spoke about his experience in starting dOrg with cooperative principles in mind as a DAO, how DAOs should learn from radical historical movements, and how working in DAOs today gives a potential peek into how work could look like under a post-capitalism. We also talked about the process of turning dOrg into the first legally recognized DAO. If you liked the podcast be sure to give it a review on your preferred podcast platform.

  > The capability approach is a theoretical framework that entails two normative claims: first, the claim that the freedom to achieve well-being is of primary moral importance and, second, that well-being should be understood in terms of people’s capabilities and functionings. Capabilities are the doings and beings that people can achieve if they so choose — their opportunity to do or be such things as being well-nourished, getting married, being educated, and travelling; functionings are capabilities that have been realized. Whether someone can convert a set of means - resources and public goods - into a functioning (i.e., whether she has a particular capability) crucially depends on certain personal, sociopolitical, and environmental conditions, which, in the capability literature, are called ‘conversion factors.’ Capabilities have also been referred to as real or substantive freedoms as they denote the freedoms that have been cleared of any potential obstacles, in contrast to mere formal rights and freedoms.

  > For professionals navigating negative corporate karmas, Leadership Lessons from the Bhagavad Gita offers a way forward for overcoming self-defeating habits and managing the mind’s negative chatter that is often the main obstacle to effective leadership. By promoting a leadership approach of caring for followers, stakeholders and future generations, the book offers hope for harmonious workplace relations and a protected environment. Based on leadership by inspiration as opposed to leadership by control, Leadership Lessons from the Bhagavad Gita provides an alternative to conventional leadership. Particularly, in the times we live, where there is a crisis of faith in leadership, the insights from this book presents a vision of linked-leadership—leaders who are linked through loving-connection or bhakti-yoga with themselves (through self-knowledge), with other beings, with nature and with the supreme source. As exemplified by Krishna taking over the reins of Arjuna’s chariot, the crux of this book is leadership, not as a title or position, but as a commitment to service, excellence and virtuous character that motivates and inspires others to pursue the same. The unique insights from this book will help you make sense of different personality types to motivate others according to their natures and inclinations, which will support you in forming effective teams and creating a harmonious and prosperous organizational culture. In short, this book challenges and equips leaders to step up and cultivate unity and diversity, and achieve sustainable wellbeing and happiness in their organizations.

Because, in the Daoist view, all beings and everything are fundamentally one, opposing opinions can arise only when people lose sight of the Whole and regard their partial truths as absolute. They are then like the frog at the bottom of the well who takes the bit of brightness he sees for the whole sky. The closed systems—i.e., the passions and prejudices into which petty minds shut themselves—hide the Dao, the “Supreme Master” who resides inside themselves

  > A prominent trend in moral philosophy today is the interest in the rich textures of actual human practices and lives. This has prompted engagements with other disciplines, such as anthropology, history, literature, law and empirical science, which have produced various forms of contextual ethics . These engagements motivate reflections on why and how context is important ethically, and such metaethical reflection is what this article undertakes. Inspired by the work of the later Wittgenstein and the Danish theologian K.E. Løgstrup, I first describe one of the ways in which context plays a central role with regard to ethical meaning and normativity. I then examine how ‘context’ is to be defined, and finally I discuss some of the questions which arise when giving context prominence in ethics – namely, how to delimit the scope of relevant context, the relevant traits of a particular context and what ‘the ethical’ is.

  > The study of human social phenomena in their proper scope demands the integrated effort of many disciplinary traditions. This fact is widely acknowledged but rarely acted upon. It is in practice often difficult to cross disciplinary boundaries, to communicate across different vocabularies, research goals, theories and methods. The aim of this Research Topic has been to make some progress in stepping across these borders.Not attempting this crossing in a subject as multi-faceted as intersubjectivity inevitably binds us to remain within self-enclosed conceptions. By this we mean a bundle of self-reinforcing perspectives, hypotheses, experimental methods, debates, communities and institutions. Traditional ways of thinking about social cognition frame the questions that are deemed worth researching. These all revolve around the issue of how we figure out other minds, assuming that other people's intentional states are hidden, private and internal. The proposed answers rely only on how the perceived indirect manifestations of other people's mental states are processed by individual cognitive mechanisms.We would like to raise, instead, the question of what an embodied science of intersubjectivity would look like if we were to start from different premises than those that delimit classical approaches to social cognition. For doing this, we thought the time was ripe for bringing together work that crosses disciplinary boundaries and informs us about different conceptions of how pe...

  > Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a condition characterized by difficulties with social interaction and communication. Studies show that people with ASD tend to enjoy using technology, as it provides them with a safe and trustworthy environment. Evaluating User eXperience (UX) in people with disabilities has been a challenge that studies have addressed in recent times. Several studies have evaluated the usability and UX of systems designed for people with ASD using evaluation methods focused on end users without disabilities. In reviewing studies that evaluate systems designed for people with ASD, considering the characteristics of these users, we discovered a lack of particularized UX models. We present a proposal of nine UX factors for people with ASD based on two approaches: (1) the characteristics, affinities, and needs of people with ASD, and (2) design guidelines and/or recommendations provided in studies on technological systems for people with ASD and/or interventions with these users. The nine UX factors for people with ASD provide a theoretical basis from which to adapt and/or create UX evaluation instruments and methods and to generate recommendations and/or design guidelines that are adequate for this context.

It involves researchers and participants working together to understand a problematic situation and change it for the better. There are many definitions of the approach, which share some common elements. PAR focuses on social change that promotes democracy and challenges inequality; is context-specific, often targeted on the needs of a particular group; is an iterative cycle of research, action and reflection; and often seeks to ‘liberate’ participants to have a greater awareness of their situation in order to take action. PAR uses a range of different methods, both qualitative and quantitative.

  > ● A SOL assembly takes place every months. These meetings carry the character of a Deep Hanging Out – we get together not in order to know what we want to learn, but in order to create an empty space for the unexpected to happen. Find out about the coming date at the bottom of this page. ● If it happens that an idea for a project emerges during the assemblies, the project is developed separately to the regular meetings. ● Anyone can be a member of SOL, anything can become a project of SOL, and it can take place anywhere, as long as it’s stimulated by the will to re-think the role of School and Love in the creation of caring societies. ● Members of SOL can come and go as they wish. There is no obligation for members to commit to be present in all SOL’s activities. ● Practices of SOL aim at blurring the difference between research and outcome, individual work and collectivity, the personal and the political. ● SOL tries to make every process or research accessible to the broad public. ● SOL and its members are lovers. They care and commit to each other, but do not wish to control what the other does with the love that they give. ● SOL engages with love that dares to bound spirituality and politics together, by putting that which is between us before that which we think belongs to us. ● In SOL there are no teachers. SOLers fall in love with things and ideas and act from this state. SOL is based on the fragility of lovers agreeing to forget who they thought they were before meeting each other.

Rebel Wisdom is a transformational media channel founded by BBC & Channel 4 journalist David Fuller, and writer Alexander Beiner. We believe we are seeing a civilisational-level crisis of ideas, as the old operating system breaks down.

She started to pave the way for that highway on 2017’s Lost On You. The title track “Lost On You,” has now been #1 in 18 countries, Diamond in Mexico and France, 4x Platinum, Platinum in Greece and Poland, Gold in Belgium and Switzerland, and has recently surpassed 1 billion streams. She’s been hailed by Billboard, Paper, Out Magazine, V Magazine, Interview, British Vogue, recently claiming the cover of Elle Mag Mexico, on top of show-stopping performances everywhere.

  > The purpose of this channel is pretty easy to sum up really: to provide lyric videos for every song Rush has released, because their lyrics deserve that. I started this project in the summer of 2011 at the tender age of 13 (as of this writing I'm 17) and finished it roughly three years later. (Well.. I say that, but of course if Rush ever release another record I will have to do videos for that as well. So who knows if it's finished?) The videos are simple for two reasons. 1: Because it puts the focus on the lyrics and 2: Because I'm terrible at making videos. These are all made with Movie Maker (Windows 7) and they're very simplistic, but why shouldn't they be? I don't really see a point in being subscribed to this channel at this point, as no new videos will be released, but no one's stopping you.

It is a movement driven, reflective platform that we have established in order to develop an artistic language that is accessible, primal, creative and playful. We are movement practitioners that are fundamentally interested in human emotion and cultural expression. Since 2002 Linda and Jozef have been developing the Fighting Monkey Practice through a deep study on cross motion analysis and with aim to understand the principles of the human movement and the ageing process. Fighting Monkey Practice is their research to expand and discover their moving capacities and desires to develop as human beings. Jozef and Linda travel around the world in schools, universities and international stages, to give seminars, workshops, lectures and performances in a journey of never ending creativity and research.

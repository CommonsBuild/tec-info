_13-May-21 11:09 AM_:

I think this is a bit late, but I think there's a small issue on the TEC-Hatch-Vote repository. Acc. to github's issue flow - People that aren't part of the org or haven't been added to the org. can't add tags while opening issues. Thus, anyone who isn't a part of the org can't add the Vote tag on the issue. I think due to this, the issue doesn't get listed on tokenlog(correct me if I am wrong here) Maybe we can set an issue template called vote and set the default tags for that template to Vote

I'm not able to authenticate with the bot that helps you add roles. Trusted seed is what I was prompted for and when I go through the process it takes me to a page that says my captcha has expired. When I reset it I get the same message. I tried giving a break between a reset and re verifying bit that didn't work either. Pretty sure I've tried all I can do at my level to troubleshoot.

_07-Dec-21 11:42 AM_:

If you look at the original praise, many people were dished praise in a single message, the praisebot tries to automatically strips the recipients out, leaving just the reason. Sometimes it is unsuccessful however.

Ive been working on a a parser for the past praise data this week. I dont have access to the repo but am noticing some bugs as I go through the data

thankfully, this bug is only affecting the reason and not the number of people being dished... An alternate parser I drafted up for the praise audit can be found here - [https://github.com/hurek/Praise-Bot-Discord/blob/main/ext/scrape_praise.py](https://github.com/hurek/Praise-Bot-Discord/blob/main/ext/scrape_praise.py) While this one isn't perfect, I think this can be fixed after a few tweaks to the regex - reason = re.sub(r'(<@).*?>', '', utils.escape_mentions(msg.content)[8:]).strip().replace('\n', ' ')

_09-Dec-21 09:30 AM_:

What Ive been doing is stripping the leading 'for' from the reason which has the added side effect of stripping out any recipients that the bot missed

unless there is a recipient in the middle of the string. But the it also makes the reason more readable as well.

_09-Dec-21 09:37 AM_:

I think 'for' is sometimes not included in the praise, which can be potentially problematic for the parser (edited)

_09-Dec-21 09:41 AM_:

Im not 100% sure, but from my reading of the past data, it appears to be a required word.

Im just parsing past data though so I have more room for trial and error than the bot does with realtime submissions

If its not a required word now, then people are gravitating to it naturally. So making it required may simplify the problem a bit.

I think I found a bug in the QV system due to signature submission. I was able to cast 37 votes on a single project, even though i only have 1125 TRUST, but Sqrt(1125)=35.5.

And only when I closed the modal to check, it did not let me resubmit.

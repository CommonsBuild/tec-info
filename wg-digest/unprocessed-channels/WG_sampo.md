‚îÅ‚îÅWORKING GROUP TEXT‚îÅ‚îÅ / üí∏ÔΩúsampo

"Sampo" is the Finnish mythic "Horn of Plenty." It symbolizes this working group's purpose: mission-driven, community-owned and governed capital to advance the field of token engineering. We focus on financial management, income generation, and the economic development that builds demand for the TEC token. Our coordination space is here: https://app.clarity.so/Sampo/

"Sampo" is the Finnish mythic "Horn of Plenty." It symbolizes this working group's purpose: mission-driven, community-owned and governed capital to advance the field of token engineering. We focus on financial management, income generation, and the economic development that builds demand for the TEC token. Here is the story, and note the failures that Ilmarinen initially faces in his early attempts to create this everlasting treasury of wealth: subjugation, aggression, ill-temper, and destruction. Yeah, kind of like our current financial system. <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f609.png" width=20 height=20>

In the end, he creates the Sampo, a magical machine that produces an endless supply of grain, salt and gold. In terms of Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs: basic security and sustenance is the grain, belonging and esteem is the salt which improves the taste of the basics, and self-actualization is the gold of a meaningful, soulful life. Am I overreaching? Yeah, maybe! But if you want to learn more about the myth, here you go:

Ilmarinen - Wikiwand

Ilmarinen , the Eternal Hammerer, blacksmith and inventor in the Kalevala, is a god[1] and archetypal artificer from Finnish mythology. He is immortal and capable of creating practically anything, but is portrayed as being unlucky in love.[2] He is described as working the known metals of the time, including brass, copper, iron, gold, and silver...

I need to understand this better. Will come back to it later today. It'd be interesting to add a column looking at the impact on tribute funding too.

For everyone planning on joining our call today at 4PM EST, please make sure to join the Clarity base before the call. Also, please make sure to edit your name so it matches whatever name you go by here on Discord, otherwise you just show up as your wallet key, which is confusing.

quick notes on convition voting

one of the most ambitious decision-making systems is the Conviction Voting or Social Sensor Fusion (Zargham, 2018). In the CV, DAO members cast votes, with an amount of the DAO token they have, in a proposal. For example, member-A has fifty tokens, and she votes with twenty tokens in the proposal-A. So, now the member-A has just thirty tokens to vote in other proposals. Hence, if she wants to use more tokens than the remaining, she will have to remove tokens from proposal-A. That is the conviction. The second key of the CV is that proposals have to pass a dynamic threshold to be approved. This threshold is tied to the treasury funds. In other words, the more budget the proposal requests, the more conviction (tokens) the proposal has to gather. Notice that if the proposal-B is approved before the proposal-A, then the DAO funds decrease, and the proposal-A threshold will increase. On the other side, if the DAO funds increase, the threshold will decrease (Emmett, 2019; CVM, 2019). The Conviction Voting was tested with simulations,14 and Aragon is testing it in a real environment (Association, 2020).

- Conviction Voting - Benefit to early voter. - vote's value is weighted by time the vote has been submitted. - a member can change its vote anytime before the proposal ends. - Problem - less research on the topic.

We chit chatted for a few minutes yesterday and gave ourselves the task of getting a copy of each working groups budget/ledger, categorizing the spending, and quantifying the rate of burn per category. Rex also suggested looking at Open Collective's UI to get an idea of how they demonstrate how spending works there and possibly being able to fork and adapt their work to our needs. But it was late yesterday for those two being in London and Florida, so I don't think anyone has made any progress yet and we'll defer to you for next steps. =)

@gene @rex @Anak - and anyone else interested in financial analysis, I've just set up a *group* in Clarity, called "Sampo Analysts" - it's here: [https://app.clarity.so/Sampo/group/ANALY](https://app.clarity.so/Sampo/group/ANALY)

Clarity ‚Äî The simplest workspace for decentralized teams

Connect your wallet, share token-gated documents, coordinate projects and proposals, track tasks, trade notes, and build your own personal Wikipedia‚Äîin a familiar all-in-one workspace.


In it, you'll see just one note, which is a "manifesto" for this work team. This mimics the process we have for setting up working groups in the TEC and I think it's a good discipline to keep things grounded in the mission, vision, and values. Here's a link to that document: [https://app.clarity.so/Sampo/notes/9901e407-f404-4d60-abfc-61ba3f03a17b](https://app.clarity.so/Sampo/notes/9901e407-f404-4d60-abfc-61ba3f03a17b)

As a next step, can one of you use Doodle to find a time to meet so we can get this team spun up and working in ways that align w/ the working group and the TEC? Include me, too. Just put the invite here in Sampo's channel: [https://doodle.com/dashboard](https://doodle.com/dashboard)

Also, @Anak and @rex -- and anyone interested in collaborating in Sampo, please make sure the name you use there matches the one you use here in TEC Discord. Otherwise it's just too damn confusing for everyone to keep track. Thanks!

We chit chatted for a few minutes yesterday and gave ourselves the task of getting a copy of each working groups budget/ledger, categorizing the spending, and quantifying the rate of burn per category. Rex also suggested looking at Open Collective's UI to get an idea of how they demonstrate how spending works there and possibly being able to fork and adapt their work to our needs. But it was late yesterday for those two being in London and Florida, so I don't think anyone has made any progress yet and we'll defer to you for next steps. =)

I did some financial statements (balance sheet, income statement, cash flow, operating expenses) for gravity in the past weeks for some proposal I did for them so I was thinking they could help with the analysis of the WGs. My plan was also to start doing those statements for other wgs at some point so maybe now can be a good time. But also I don‚Äôt wanna us to overlap on the work so let me know what you guys think [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Pd8feP0zW_mKaFesocYOMtpqTZMIUzWgZcQMUKmL6bI/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Pd8feP0zW_mKaFesocYOMtpqTZMIUzWgZcQMUKmL6bI/edit?usp=sharing) (edited)

Is there a reason why there isn't a separate line item on the March income statement for the income from the Gitcoin grant? Sorry, I'm not an accountant. But I am planning to do some grant writing for the TEC and some of the individual working groups; would it be correct to account for grant receipts as something like "unearned income?"

Yes, that‚Äôs some of the questions I had myself too while doing this. I have a background in business but not specifically in accounting so I think there are some specifics that would be good to get advise on, specially for the balance sheet as I had a hard time figuring out how the different assets/liabilities/equity would look like for wgs. To what you are saying I think that could be right but maybe as part of the balance sheet instead? For the income statement I would leave it for direct income wgs could have based on sales of some service/product

what part of the bookeeping can we automate?

Just an idea (we could ignore it for now): I recommend using text-based double-entry accounting for ledger. advantage 1. data is easy to clean, collect, modify (because it is text base) 2. easy to filter parts of information that we want while minimize human error. the image shows that we can do things like get balance of X account (can be nested infinitely).

@bear100 from the highlights in pics. costs is included per-event right? one of the goal is to determine burn rate within each expenses category that can be reduced. First thing to look at is duplicate expenses, but the detail of expense is lagging to make any decision. any ideas how to find out duplicate expense that can be reduced? also, are the variable costs montly expenses, recurring, per-project? This information is important because we can identify duplicate cost that occurs in different months. (edited)

Thats a really good question. I think going for automation in most of our processes should be one of the goals but I dont really know how to do it and the tools needed. Right now the most automated thing I can think of is Dune dahsboard and dework for compensation. It would be interesting to find a way to incorporate that data and translate it into more structured reports that could make the analysis easier and automated

_08-May-22 03:22 PM_:

Correct, so there were two cases in april 300 each = 600 for both cases. I agree on what you are saying about detail lagging. And thats an interesting challenge as well because so far what Ive encounter is that each WG does things differently including how they report their expenses and the detail with it. In this case with Gravity they have this document [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-Mh6vJ2Xqrsw8Gkd1v-D7r7zoyz87-pFFpdIrddBjGQ/edit#gid=860672135](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-Mh6vJ2Xqrsw8Gkd1v-D7r7zoyz87-pFFpdIrddBjGQ/edit#gid=860672135) where they register with a little more detail their transactions.

Variable costs are not recurring per project because projects change a lot every month. We could say that more than a project is a cost per task

we should set a protocol for reporting to include minimum information. Adding more column in the sheets would do. Once we agree on category. we can have google sheet group expense up based on description.

I don't have access to modify Gravity. I will be watiing for confirmation on budget category and we can add more columns to get minimum information required for proper book keeping.

_08-May-22 10:42 PM_:

Something I would point out here would be the differentiation between expenses that happen every month (fixed) like salaries vs expenses that change from month to month (variable) ex. advisory. I think it would be important to keep those categories as to give us a better ideas of the spending behavior of the group but then maybe we could create sub categories?

First of all, those graphics are awesome! I love those, @markop And thanks to Gene, you have the link to our workspace on Clarity, but here's a short description in case you don't feel like jumping in: "Sampo" is the Finnish mythic "Horn of Plenty." It symbolizes this working group's purpose: mission-driven, community-owned and governed capital to advance the field of token engineering. We focus on financial management, income generation, and the economic development that builds demand for the TEC token. Also, here's the message above where I explain the name:

This is great Gideon! It is a great overview of what Sampo is looking to achieve. I think having these 3 phases will provide a lot of clarity and focus between the members of the wg towards generating and achieving very specific objectives within each phase  <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f64c.png" width=20 height=20>

_24-May-22 12:33 PM_:

‚ÄúThe reduction in the total amount of wxDai in the CP will continue to place limits on the amount of funds that can be asked for with any given proposal. With an 11% spending limit, the spending cap will be ~50,000 wxDai when the total funds in the CP reaches ~450,000 wxDai.‚Äù - based on @natesuits financial analysis

So based on the numbers I did wgs had a total operating spending of 50,000 during April, assuming we keep this spending rate (it could keep increasing) and considering the balance of the cp of 720782.77, the funds would last for 5 more months until we hit that point Nate mentions and then I think it will get really complicated to fund proposals. (edited)

If im not missing any more factors, I think it‚Äôs crucial that the tec knows about this info

by the way @bear100

on your spreadsheet

under WGs monthly spending

can we add a row being TEC treasury balance on the 1st of that month (edited)

and then work out = (monthly spend) /balance over time?

I've requested access to your sheet, I believe we can trend that out and see when we'd hit the '11%'

_06-Jun-22 12:51 PM_:

Lively conversation on the Sampo funding proposal on the forum. I just replied the following to @akrtws (TE Academy): I will amend the proposal, @akrtws. I‚Äôm adding treasury management to tomorrow‚Äôs Sampo call. What I‚Äôm thinking right now is having a part-time treasury coordination lead to drive this effort. This will add to the proposal costs, but it‚Äôs clear there‚Äôs energy here and it will more than pay for itself. The first step will be figuring out how we modify the parameters on conviction voting to free up enough funds from the common pool to generate meaningful yield. From there, it will be more about risk-reward policies and the actual management of the fund. Nailing these details will be the purpose of this part of the call. I will mention this in the Sampo channel. If anyone is interested, please connect there. I also recommend you attend tomorrow‚Äôs call if you can. cc: @Zeptimus, @gene, @Mert Ozd, @natesuits, @kristofer (edited)

_06-Jun-22 01:19 PM_:

It's an interesting question, @gene. I'll be interested to see if others have ideas. While it's not *today*, my sense is that our nearest-term opportunities are, in fact, from yield (now that we know changing conviction voting params is doable), and maybe from a couple of well-chosen grant applications. Beyond that, i think it comes from drawing on culture through things like NFTs. Token utility can also start to grow relatively soon. Services will take the longest time to plan and build, but they have the greatest potential for making a meaningful impact.

Thanks @Gideonro for the kind response. I'm also particularly interested to hear what ideas others might have. I suspect that there are some serious gems right below the surface here just waiting to be unearthed. @kristofer mentioned now is the time for "controversial ideas" and I still agree. I'm drafting a forum post for a safe space to speak about controversial/"dumb"/moonshot ideas because I think there exists potential for people to remain quiet despite the fact that they may have a wonderful idea but are either afraid, or not sufficiently encouraged to share it. We need to mitigate that fear, and encourage that confidence. Ideas don't even have to be complete. Indeed the beginnings of the best ideas rarely, if ever, are. Just an inkling or a glimmer of suspicion could lead us to the abundance we seek.

yes, that's an interesting frame. Sampo is actually a mix of finance, business and services development, and fundraising at this point. over time, I'm guessing these could splinter off into distinct areas with finance as it's own thing

Considering that our products/services/token utility are still in development process and might be more of a medium to long term revenue stream, I‚Äôve been thinking that something we could sell in the short term, and to answer to your question, is the VISION/FUTURE of what we want the TEC to become and then focus on not just deliver that, but to over deliver in what we promise. One of the most obvious ways to achieve this probably is through fundraising, but we can get more creative as well, and in my opinion, and a model that‚Äôs been proven to work extremely well to raise money in a short amount of time, is a NFT 10,000 PFP collection. I don‚Äôt see why a llamas/pickles/apes collection could raise those amounts of money and not us. But there‚Äôs a big difference in the value proposition, the culture, the community and the plans the TEC has compared to those other projects, and I think that would make the difference in the long term.

_08-Jun-22 10:55 AM_:

I spent a little time digging into yearn the other night after Trent indicated this was a safe, straightforward option in his eyes, and in terms of the safety, from what I was able to gather, I would have to agree at this point. The protocol is intimately entwined with curve.fi and this implies further downstream synergies from multiple angles like the onsen function within sushi, pickle.finance, convex.finance, etc etc. The vault tokens are liquid even if the underlying assets are not. The an essential concept, as far as I could deduce, in terms of safety, is that the potential for value accumulation is almost irrefutable, if not entirely, based on the fact that tokens will continue to be added to the vault, and thus the vault price will continue to rise. That type of statement is usually foolhardy, I know, but I would encourage anyone to go ahead and read the docs, try to understand the concepts, and let's try to come together and re-explain these concepts to each other in plain language. Probably the most important aspect of all to be mindful of is not measuring the possibility for returns based on APR/APY but on a more general ROI consideration.

There is definitely a distinction between a working group and other types of projects. Having just set up Sampo, there is a fair amount of process that goes into a working group set up (manifesto, etc.). And there is an advice process that you go through before putting the manifesto up on the forum: [https://token-engineering-commons.gitbook.io/tec-handbook/governance/advice-process](https://token-engineering-commons.gitbook.io/tec-handbook/governance/advice-process) But eventually, working groups and other projects both post a funding proposal on the forum before it goes to conviction voting.

I've thought further since my last post, but will try to synch in. Are all WG discussions recorded? Or is there a Sampo group folder with documents I could browse?

@here For the squad that is interested in doing modelling with Sampo. I am suggesting that we sync in a 15 minute slot in the weekly WG instead of creating additional calls. I'm selfishly proposing this because the Sampo WG call is very good timing for me, and I want to avoid the overhead of setting up additional calls. I don't want to discourage people to continue connecting and collaborating, that's amazing. But for my personal involvement, I really prefer to make sync progress during the WG hour to set ourselves up for async work throughout the week. Cheers! PS don't let the markets get you down, pretty cool that TEC is backed by stables at this time.

Hey everyone, so I'm about to start testing a few token gating tools so we can have a more direct way to talk to token holders as well as probably offer some other things down the road - I was going to wait till the next Sampo meeting but I think we can perfectly have this discussion async for the most part

_16-Jun-22 01:03 PM_:

What would the logic look like? Guild has these options while Collab.land seems just to have "AND", still testing and learning the tool though

![https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/969685567455498310/987039819093905438/unknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/969685567455498310/987039819093905438/unknown.png)

I suppose AND should be enough for pretty much anything (doesn't seem like we want to do anything too complex)

Hi, not a member. I missed somehow until now, alos I'm not a dev anymore. I have a legal question about the commons stack. As I know the commons stack is a association according to swiss law, I also did find the bylaw. I'm swiss and live in switzerland. I currently advise a carbon sink stablecoin, a DAO and we are looking for a legal structur. What I also just did find is a Foundation with the name "Token Commons Foundation", but thats not the association. Can anybody DM me?

Hey TEC I'm an account manager (cleric) coming over from RaidGuild looking for some assistance. Don't mean to come barging in but I'm really struggling to find some help. In our weekly meetup there was a suggestion of popping over to the the TEC folks for an assist.

Hello Guys

I read the documentation from gitbook and medium

I have a few thing that I would like to clarify.

I understood that the purpose of the funding is to develop tools / application that serve as a technical layer to the TE methodoloy and applied concept.

Is that correct ?

The thing that I did not get is how contributor are actually reward from participating to the selection of the tools to developped ?

I mean I would expect a mechanism by which a contribution is sent back to the backer of a project once this project is live and used by application

Hey, I'm not sure if I fully understand what you're asking, but I think you're talking about revenue streams back to the TEC and its backers from projects that are supported? I don't think this is a requirement, but could be something you want to assess in proposals to the DAO that you are supporting/challenging. I expect that not all of the proposals will have explicit profit motives though, as the DAO is intended to support Token Engineering and its advancement as a field, which is generally more likely to be a common good than a revenue stream. There very well may be paybacks made if projects spun out start to realize profit, but I think that is too far in the future to be projecting with any certainty. That's just me though!

This is exactly my point. So basically, what you are explaining is that as a dao menber, I will buy token to have some right for example selecting a project to be funded but I expect no financial return from it. This is a charity fundation, it‚Äôs only from donation than. Interesting (re @Krisjones: Hey, I'm not sure if I fully understand what you're asking, but I think you're talking about revenue streams back to the TEC and its backers from projects that are supported?

A synergistically 3 in 1 complementary currency system. 1. A simple mutual credit system. Supported with a levy-rate-system for community interests. For families, small orgs, and small businesses. Works online, although can be backed up to function offline in case of disaster or to start up the whole system. 2. A simple micro mutual credit system. Supported with a demurrage-rate-system for professional orientation. This system is more likely to function and thrive online. 3. A local green real estate project co-owned through fractional nft's. A DAO. If you make an account you get access to these 3 systems. This enables you to earn cc 1 and trade them with cc 3. Or cc 2 for cc 1. And so on. This means you can use the strengths of a cc and then avoid the disadvantages of that particular cc. An example. You can use the benefit of a cc with demurrage, but then get out of it to go to a fractional nft. So I splitted some functions of money (circulation and savings) in each its own cc, but then I combined them with respect to their own nature. So they don't mess up eachother, but complement eachother. I would run this as an app on the holochain as this is the decentralized web. Ultrafast. Secure. Unlimited scalable. Green. Cheap. Highly valuable. Works offline. Next-gen crypto-tech. Can this be made on neighborhoods? Can I get any funds through SEEDS? Who can mentor me?

It's hard to say where it will go as the risk on assets in the market are very volatile due to the fed talk this past week. I suspect that in March we will get a clearer picture of what direction these types of assets will head depending on the amount that the fed decides to raise interest rates and we get a clearer picture as to how many rate hikes we will see this year. Take this all with a grain of salt and I am more than open to hearing counter arguments on this as well.

Hello there! There is a new not so new, Working Group, call Reward System. There is a thread for quantifiers. Also, @mitch (üçî, üçî) is taking the lead on that, he could provide you more information about it.

@üêô octopus @gerlindgrosse Sorry for the confusion! We are still on the process to finish the build of a Reward system, and praise is going to be part of that. We have documentation regarding the Praise system: [https://forum.tecommons.org/t/rules-of-praise-and-quantification/667](https://forum.tecommons.org/t/rules-of-praise-and-quantification/667)

Rules of Praise and Quantification <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f46f.png" width=20 height=20>

Who can praise? Anyone who wishes to do so. This person should contact a Steward directly to request praise powers. Praise powers can be retrieved in case of malicious action - see the Community Covenant for reference. <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f49b.png" width=20 height=20>

1. In the new process, will praise still eventually lead to opportunities for TEC tokens? Has that aspect changed now that the token has launched? 2. If TEC tokens are a potential result of praise, how does someone make sure they're able to get them?

I can say yes you will be rewarded with TEC tokens. We've built a praise dashboard and are in the process of testing it out.

Hi everyone! I wanted to share this draft that applies Augmented Bonding Curve in the context of an organization wanting to "exit to community". Open Collective is a profitable startup that wants to return investor money through an exit to community versus IPO / acquisition and they are soliciting inputs for possible pathways. The article is an attempt to explore if the incentive alignment and funding enabled by the bonding curve can be paired with a tailored governance setup to facilitate such an exit to community. Would love to hear your feedback.

_13-Feb-22 02:17 AM_:

It strikes me often that very very bright people can often be very very sensitive. I have a family member who is like this. Learning to build communities that can harness the talent of such people means we don't continually repeat the treatment Alan Turing got. This strikes me as something humanity needs to learn, both collectively and quickly. I hope TEC are also heading in this direction, but inevitably individual upsets will occur, which could turn into dispute. I urge folk here to find the #üïäÔΩúgravity proposal in the community forum and support the work we are proposing, so ably hosted, prompted and supported by @Juankbell . It must be true for every DAO that we don't want continually to inadvertently push bright babies out with small amounts of bathwater. Thanks, I'll happily engage in dialogue if folk are interested.

A Sneak Peak into DAOhaus v3

In 2019, DAOhaus was born out of a community building coordination tools for themselves. Originally called Pokemol, it was a simple user interface to manage membership, voting and proposals for Moloch DAOs. As more communities were drawn to Moloch DAOs and required a no-code way to summon new DAOs, we built the original DAOhaus app.

I was thinking of deploying on matic, but the requirements for the currency is 'offline' support.

If that's not the case, a mutual credit system - there are a few versions, one in Kenya one in Slovenia - will highlight where folk are struggling to provide value. Then action can be taken to suggest provision of manual or digital admin services to those who are thriving to rebalance the overall system. Those who are thriving might offer simple bounty options in community for example, offering credits to strugglers rather than coin. Mutual credit avoids all the coin minting activity, and could be a system to nurture enterprise in early forms. Happy to discuss / DM if this interests. Koru DAO are looking at this option strongly ...

Hey @Tam2140 , not sure who to ask this of, maybe you can suggest ... The bottom up nature of a DAO makes it quite difficult or at least fluid to provide a vision / mission statement, and even product / service flyers, because change percolates upwards, meaning high level views need rather more flexibility than in the corporate world. TLDR: However, from a learning curve perspective, together with views on current projects, such documents are essential navigation tools for folk joining DAOs and wanting to gravitate rapidly towards areas of common interest, where they can make an impact. Which DAOs can you see that see this the best? I'd love to find, join or form a DAO with folk similarly interested in growth paths, because I think DAOs give us all the opportunity to grow. Conversely this still works well, because DAOs that pay attention to growing individuals will themselves grow much more rapidly. And I'm talking both skills and results here, not growth in the one dimensional way that Web 2 looks at things. Over to you, interested to hear what you or others suggest.

0mega Cheat Sheet

0mega Cheat Sheet what token engineering effectively can do is "retooling the motivations that underlie decision-making" - we can't "make people do things" nor are we legit to think we can - but we can retool the motivations... mind and mental models being the most effective tools enable systems...

_25-Feb-22 06:35 AM_:

Brilliant cheat sheet, I love these! I did notice in the TEC Source document, there is no explicit mention of learning, although obviously there is implicit learning on show. I do feel learning curves in DAOs are important, and that those learning curves are important to making DAOs more effective and much more quickly. The elusive productivity that corporates complain about so often. Grow each individual, grow the organisation, is the founding principle. I would love to drop into Omega WG with this discussion, but not if it's going to be disruptive. Do you think folk there would be receptive, or is it a bit left field?

Hi, all -- I made a short explainer video of a project overview -- the tokenomics are more nuanced, and I think it could be a learning opportunity for folks here. I can set up a call which we record that shares my simplified framework and how it applies

Assembly - Restoring Democracy Overview

This video is an overview of how Assembly restores democracy by increasing voter education and participation while adding transparency to funding and advertising content.

But I thought sharing the concept at a high level would help

Who would be interested to connecting?

Tokenomics question for the smartest people in tokenomics. Why is the MATIC price so low Polygon just raised 450M so the perceived value of the tech/network is good. And since the token is required for the network that should also get some of the benefit. Plus the demand is absolute. Like there is no other token you can use for gas. So is it low because paying gas is the only utility? No one holds on to it because they only buy to pay gas? Are there other reasons?

_06-Mar-22 09:40 AM_:

The price is relative to supply and demand. How bullish (uptrend), bearish(downtrend) investment companies and whales are is dependent on the interest rate. Many factors can play into the interest rate such as CPI. (Consumer Price Index). Matic was very high at the end of December. But with December having higher interest rates than november. Investors began to roll out. Whales also tend to follow suit too. Bitcoin and all cryptocurrencies are classed a "risk-on" assets. Some mention this is due to volatility. But the main factor is because it does not have the security of a centralised bank to back it up. (Even though you would think centralised banks are the ones which are more risky. I know right, it's mad) So when something happens such as high inflation/threat of war time it can spook investors. And everyone moves with the largest players. There was a brief bull market that has popped out a few times. I'm not the smartest but this is what I have come to learn

_06-Mar-22 09:44 AM_:

Matic can only be used with other matic addresses. Otherwise it can cost ethereum to move it over through the polygon bridge. It's something to watch out for. Some places may support the matic token but may not support the polygon blockchain. Or some will support matic on the matic network. But you might not be able to move usdt (which was what I experienced with kucoin with usdt and usdc). As long as the address you are pointing at supports matic. Then Yes, you can get lower fees

_06-Mar-22 09:50 AM_:

My apologies. I have I think undiagnosed adhd, and perhaps undiagnosed autism. So I hope I answered your question. Many hold onto matic because a lot of techbnology exists there. Even uniswap moved there. Lower fees support a lot of this new "game-fi", nft gaming things that are emerging. There are a few EVM (ethereum virtual machine like) blockchains that can perform their own transactions and have their own bridges to ethereum. Matic is special in how from what I understand it contains the core of ethereum at its heart. So its block chain is kinda like a wrapper to the ethereum blockchain. Any address on ethereum exists in polygon/matic, but not every account in matic "sort of" exists in ethereum.

[My apologies. I have I think undiagnosed adhd, and perhaps undiagnosed autism. So I hope I answered your question. Many hold onto matic because a lot of techbnology exists there. Even uniswap moved there. Lower fees support a lot of this new "game-fi", nft gaming things that are emerging. There are a few EVM (ethereum virtual machine like) blockchains that can perform their own transactions and have their own bridges to ethereum. Matic is special in how from what I understand it contains the core of ethereum at its heart. So its block chain is kinda like a wrapper to the ethereum blockchain. Any address on ethereum exists in polygon/matic, but not every account in matic "sort of" exists in ethereum.](about:blank#)

Hey TEC - Wanted to share a quick update from the TE Academy! We are kicking off a new program to help folks dive one level deeper into the TE field - **Token Engineering 360** - and are looking for community members to contribute and help make it happen! After the successful collaboration with the TEC on our ‚ÄúIntroduction to Token Engineering‚Äù sessions, we thought this program would be another great chance to collaborate. We are looking for 1-2 people interested in - learning Token Engineering - further developing this program - taking over operational tasks and available around 2 hours per week. **Token Engineering 360** will be a 6-session discussion series that provides a 360 degree overview of Token Engineering and crypto-economic systems. You can find more program details here [https://tokenengineeringcommunity.github.io/website/docs/academy-welcome#token-engineering-360](https://tokenengineeringcommunity.github.io/website/docs/academy-welcome#token-engineering-360). It‚Äôs also part of our efforts to engage with future students of TE Fundamentals (we‚Äôve collected > 500 sign ups so far!), and onboard them into this community. If you are interested, send me a message on discord for more detail!

CCG Chronicles #4 - Is there nothing better than liberal democracy?...

This episode is a continuation of the CCG Chronicles series which is a collection of interviews conducted during the¬†Crypto Commons Gathering¬†(CCG) in Austria back in August 2021. The interviews were also filmed to potentially be a part of a documentary I‚Äôm making with a few others. I interviewed¬†Grace Rachmany,¬† founder of¬†Voice of Humanity¬†and...

hello folks.. qq - Say, there's a DAO that helps creators have their projects funded where backers pledge some DAO token, $DAO-X. The creators have to typically sell these $DAO-X tokens for $USD in order to produce their projects in real world. This might cause the value of $DAO-X steadily going down. How do creator DAOs typically manage this downward sell pressure of the token?

[Hey TEC - Wanted to share a quick update from the TE Academy! We are kicking off a new program to help folks dive one level deeper into the TE field - **Token Engineering 360** - and are looking for community members to contribute and help make it happen! After the successful collaboration with the TEC on our ‚ÄúIntroduction to Token Engineering‚Äù sessions, we thought this program would be another great chance to collaborate. We are looking for 1-2 people interested in - learning Token Engineering - further developing this program - taking over operational tasks and available around 2 hours per week. **Token Engineering 360** will be a 6-session discussion series that provides a 360 degree overview of Token Engineering and crypto-economic systems. You can find more program details here](about:blank#)

Thanks @Tam2140 .

@everyone The New Reward System is in full swing of praise quantifications and I am once again humbly asking for

**more Quantifiers**

to participate in processing all of the wonderful praise action happening in the TEC. <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f64f.png" width=20 height=20>

Quantifications are actively ongoing with new rounds happening every week! ‚ú® If you're a new or seasoned contributor I would like to invite you to participate in this crucial role within our Commons. Quantifiers will even receive TEC tokens (Retroactively, once Reward System is finished development) for their valuable work! <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1fa99.png" width=20 height=20>

Time commitment in the near term will be

**1-2 hours weekly**

, however many hands make for light work so we need as many members as possible to join our Quantifier Pool! <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f64c.png" width=20 height=20>

We're still in active development of the Reward System so especially in this moment, this is the opportunity to provide a

**simple and very meaningful contribution**

to the evolution of the TEC with your participation and feedback! To learn more about the Reward System (and the Quantifier's role) and how to quantify, check out this content - Outlining the Reward System:

Outlining the Rewards System Process.. v2!

Rewards System Process The purpose of this system is to create a way to record, reward and analyze fairly the work done by contributors to the TEC, creating a manner of providing decentralized updates of the action happening in the Commons.

Who can praise? Anyone who wishes to do so. This person should contact a Steward directly to request praise powers. Praise powers can be retrieved in case of malicious action - see the Community Covenant for reference. <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f49b.png" width=20 height=20>

Token Engineering

The Challenge Creating tokenized ecosystems is hard. How do we figure out what we want? How do we manifest that intent with block rewards and other crypto building blocks? How do we simulate and validate the design? How do we anticipate attacks and respond to them? How do we update the protocols? Given that these systems are wildly powerful, how...

Hello everyone, Hopefully I am at the right place to ask this question about tokenomics: Why do Protocols tend now to spend so much energy on trying to recover and own liquidity, while they could just allocate a certain percent of tokenomics to permanent liquidity and lock it up in the first place in a decentralised manner through smart contract ? I guess the question is also about never really understanding why Projects had to Chase so hard for mercenary LP in the first place instead of doing exactly that, allocating locked liquidity ratio from scratch?^^ If someone can help me understand this, I would very appreciate Thx

_23-Mar-22 10:33 AM_:

Nope, the Augmented Bonding Curve (ABC) provides funding to the TEC. For example when you buy or sell TEC directly from the ABC ([https://convert.tecommons.org/)](https://convert.tecommons.org/)) a percentage of that transaction is directly sent to the Common Pool to provide funding

The initial funding came from the hatch, all this may bring more questions than answers tho lol I encourage you to read more about that in blog posts like these [https://medium.com/commonsstack/deep-dive-augmented-bonding-curves-b5ca4fad4436](https://medium.com/commonsstack/deep-dive-augmented-bonding-curves-b5ca4fad4436) [https://medium.com/commonsstack/whats-in-a-hatch-3799a398243a](https://medium.com/commonsstack/whats-in-a-hatch-3799a398243a) and come back with any questions you may encounter there, I'm sure anyone here would be more than happy to answer them

[How does one become eligible to dish praise?](about:blank#)

As of yet, the access to praise is controlled by the Praise Giver role. In most cases, the role is assigned by the community guides or the stewards after they've onboarded new members to praise. And in case, anyone would lie praise powers, they could go ahead and just ask for them. (*this isn't very scalable, and there's been discussions of integrating other verification methods - BrightID, or a reputation check(based on how much time someone's spent in the server + if they have CSTK tokens + if they already have significant amount of praise dished to them)) (edited)

We don't know everything about psychology. And I am not qualified to speak about this. But I feel the tokenomics should reflect some incentive to ease the peace. This community needs a psychology department. Yet it doesn't because those who crave power are those who don't deserve it. And humans bitch. It's what they do. Like no one gets it. I sound crazy.

um, I'm a little uncertain about what's the context over here... The praise access is mostly gated to prevent bots from abusing the system, and to ensure that new members can get an introduction to praise so that they can understand how to use praise... Talking about psychology - The TEC does have working groups that engage in conversations discussing topics related to psychology. (esp. Gravity, Omega)


Actually, there's also some workstream about doing psychology research, that Gravity is starting - [https://discord.com/events/810180621930070088/954387676017094697](https://discord.com/events/810180621930070088/954387676017094697) (maybe you can show up to that call, and share your ideas/concerns?)

_30-Mar-22 12:56 AM_:

@Hatcher The TEC is joining the initiative to build the Proposal Inverter (PI)! Myself, @Nuggan, @ygg_anderson, @chuygarcia.eth with the Comms Team and @Mert Ozd will be using our talents and knowledge to make this a major benefit for Token Engineering. **What is the Propsal Inverter?** The proposal inverter inverts the DAO-proposal relationship. Such that, instead of having many proposals for a single DAO, we will have many DAOs for a single proposal. This enables the collaborative funding of proposals that benefit multiple DAOs throughout the ecosystem. This works via a system of three entities, Proposal Owner, Payers and Contributors (formerly Brokers). **Okay, what do you want?** While we are joining with a team of contributors we also have the opportunity to kick in some community funds to make the PI functional, robust and well-communicated. Other notable DAOs have signalled funding support, including Gitcoin, PrimeDAO and Radicle Drips. **The Proposal Inverter Team is asking for 30k in xDAI from the TEC Common Pool** for PI Development. You can find the vote on the TEC Garden - [https://gardens.1hive.org/#/xdai/garden/0x1fc7e8d8e4bbbef77a4d035aec189373b52125a8/proposal/17](https://gardens.1hive.org/#/xdai/garden/0x1fc7e8d8e4bbbef77a4d035aec189373b52125a8/proposal/17) I would invite any curious TEC holders to check out this forum post that provides a more detailed explanation of the proposal. Please ask any questions or leave comments there. [https://forum.tecommons.org/t/dogfooding-the-proposal-inverter-meta-proposal/955](https://forum.tecommons.org/t/dogfooding-the-proposal-inverter-meta-proposal/955) If you're looking for a technical overview of the PI system you can check out this post - [https://forum.tecommons.org/t/dogfooding-the-proposal-inverter-tec-as-a-payer-funder-sponsor/804](https://forum.tecommons.org/t/dogfooding-the-proposal-inverter-tec-as-a-payer-funder-sponsor/804) The 30k funds will be sent directly to the Proposal Inverter Vault, a Gnosis Safe held by members of PrimeDAO, Long Tail Finance and the TEC which will then be dripped out to contributors once development begins.

Dogfooding the Proposal Inverter-Meta Proposal

Dogfooding the Proposal Inverter-Meta Proposal TL;DR The ‚ÄòProposal Inverter‚Äô (PI) is a high-demand DeFi component since the inception of the DAO ecosystem. It is meant to tackle the issue of inconvenient and unnecessarily lengthy communications experienced between researchers and funders. The proposal inverter inverts the DAO-proposal relatio...

Dogfooding the Proposal Inverter - TEC as a payer(funder/sponsor)

Dogfooding the Proposal Inverter A joint effort has been underway towards the development of the proposal inverter.

Moo here from Namo, where we‚Äôre building a social-fi platform that will operate as a social economy for art & music. The undertaking is relatively complex as we‚Äôre designing an interact to earn economy which functions as a social network for rental and investment in NFT art & music.

Am wondering if anyone here can point me to a good token engineering firm we could engage?

Already tried Block Science and they say they're busy

This is a leap forward to more collaborative allocation of funds! Great decision & Thank you all for driving it forward <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f44f.png" width=50 height=50> <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f44f.png" width=50 height=50> <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f44f.png" width=20 height=20>

(re @geleeroyale_bot: divine_comedian @Hatcher The TEC is joining the initiative to build the Proposal Inverter (PI)! Myself, @Nuggan, @ygg_anderson, @chuygarcia.eth with the Comms Team and @Mert Ozd will be using our talents and knowledge to make this a major benefit for Token Engineering.

**What is the Propsal Inverter?**

The proposal inverter inverts the DAO-proposal relationship. Such that, instead of having many proposals for a single DAO, we will have many DAOs for a single proposal. This enables the collaborative funding of proposals that benefit multiple DAOs throughout the ecosystem. This works via a system of three entities, Proposal Owner, Payers and Contributors (formerly Brokers).

**Okay, what do you want?**

While we are joining with a team of contributors we also have the opportunity to kick in some community funds to make the PI functional, robust and well-communicated. Other notable DAOs have signalled funding support, including Gitcoin, PrimeDAO and Radicle Drips.

**The Proposal Inverter Team is asking for 30k in xDAI from the TEC Common Pool**

for PI Development. You can find the vote on the TEC Garden -

[https://gardens.1hive.org/#/xdai/garden/0x1fc7e8d8e4bbbef77a4d035aec189373b52125a8/proposal/17](https://gardens.1hive.org/#/xdai/garden/0x1fc7e8d8e4bbbef77a4d035aec189373b52125a8/proposal/17)

I would invite any curious TEC holders to check out this forum post that provides a more detailed explanation of the proposal. Please ask any questions or leave comments there.

The Challenge Creating tokenized ecosystems is hard. How do we figure out what we want? How do we manifest that intent with block rewards and other crypto building blocks? How do we simulate and validate the design? How do we anticipate attacks and respond to them? How do we update the protocols? Given that these systems are wildly powerful, how...

tbosman 09-Apr-22 05:54 AM

Hi everyone, Just joined, really great this community exists! I am hoping to collect some input on a technical and an ethical question about a project I am working on. Some background: I am considering joining a company as a CTO that has developed an ESG (Environment, Social & Governance) auditing tool. They now want to build a block chain-based responsible sourcing network for auditing supply chains. There are responsible sourcing blockchains out there (like IBM's RSBN), but according to the ESG expert I spoke to this is essentially window dressing, as there is no proper mechanism to ensure the data added to the chain is correct. I am hopeful this is an opportunity to affect real change, as the founders have access to the right networks through their current business and prior careers. As they put it: they can get around the table with "the old white men" who got obscenely rich destroying the planet and now want to make amends. I have no problem with leveraging their influence if helps the environment. I am also 100% convinced of the integrity of the founders (eg they would never condone green washing).

Looking for prior work or research on using tokenized, crypto-based systems for auditing. I am particularly interested in the mechanism design behind it: how can we make things bribery and collusion proof, how to incentivize auditors properly, how to deal with privacy and transparency. I can't image we are the first ones thinking about this from a technical point of view, but it's very hard to sift through all the corporate nonsense that describe how blockchain is going to change the world of auditing, without saying anything of substance. If anyone has ideas of different application with a similar mechanism that would be helpful to.

I am experiencing some ethical conflicts around the project. What bothers me is that the industry they are in is still very much built around patents, NDAs, proprietary datasets etc. All this stuff goes against my principles. I know I am not going to convince anyone to transform into a DAO, but the least I can do is try to steer the business to a more open source approach going forward. It's delicate topic though, especially with people who never experienced how you can have profitable and open business models. I guess I want some ideas on how to best introduce that line of thinking. (edited)

[Hi everyone, Just joined, really great this community exists! I am hoping to collect some input on a technical and an ethical question about a project I am working on. Some background: I am considering joining a company as a CTO that has developed an ESG (Environment, Social & Governance) auditing tool. They now want to build a block chain-based responsible sourcing network for auditing supply chains. There are responsible sourcing blockchains out there (like IBM's RSBN), but according to the ESG expert I spoke to this is essentially window dressing, as there is no proper mechanism to ensure the data added to the chain is correct. I am hopeful this is an opportunity to affect real change, as the founders have access to the right networks through their current business and prior careers. As they put it: they can get around the table with "the old white men" who got obscenely rich destroying the planet and now want to make amends. I have no problem with leveraging their influence if helps the environment. I am also 100% convinced of the integrity of the founders (eg they would never condone green washing).](about:blank#)

Hello there! This is a very complex topic indeed. First of all, thanks for sharing your concern and intentions. I would like to tag @akrtws (TE Academy) , @JeffEmmett and @griff (üíú, üíú) who are thinking leaders on the TEC, to check if they have any insight on this topic. As a disclaimer: this would fall more into a conversation rather than an advice.

If we can identify an underlying current that could be of interest to more token ecosystems, we could initiate research/focus group into. Wrt supply chains Sweetbridge seemed to have a good analysis also wrt open source SaaS token model (back in the day). Hope it's a useful starting point for your investigation [https://sweetbridge.com/](https://sweetbridge.com/) (re @geleeroyale_bot: tbosman I am experiencing some ethical conflicts around the project. What bothers me is that the industry they are in is still very much built around patents, NDAs, proprietary datasets etc. All this stuff goes against my principles. I know I am not going to convince anyone to transform into a DAO, but the least I can do is try to steer the business to a more open source approach going forward. It's delicate topic though, especially with people who never experienced how you can have profitable and open business models. I guess I want some ideas on how to best introduce that line of thinking.)

I am not opposed to open source. I am a proponent for clearly understanding the goal. Shouldn‚Äôt the goal of open source be to enable the majority of humans to safely instruct machines? Less than a third of 1% of people know how to write code. Therefore, if a small piece of a solution is proprietary yet opens up the ability to instruct machines to 100% of humanity, isn‚Äôt that consistent with the goal of open source? In other words, is open source really open if the overwhelming majority of humans don‚Äôt know how to use it? Or is it like Michael Jackson singing he‚Äôs ‚Äúbad‚Äù when he doesn‚Äôt really mean it?

You make a good point, and I am totally pattern matching on words instead of intent here. I guess there are loads of valid reasons to use a closed solution. I just like a 'bias for openness' type approach.

[You make a good point, and I am totally pattern matching on words instead of intent here. I guess there are loads of valid reasons to use a closed solution. I just like a 'bias for openness' type approach.](about:blank#)

_13-Apr-22 10:18 AM_:

There are similar reflections to be made on repurposing fiat, via BTC, into ReFi crypto projects. I'm like you, I find openness much easier to work with, but am reassured that human folk are helping a transition away from closed systems into more open systems, with more open market places, and Employment 2.0. Coin Market Cap confirms this for me with a $2TN+ market valuation, with BTC only one part of that marketplace. For me, it's key to look at what is being funded and supported, and greater visibility for proposals, and the value metrics they have and deliver against. Then we can join in ourselves and recruit others to projects we care deeply about, with defined goals we agree with and will work towards. In a connected world, it can also be about who we choose to work with, and maybe that's a question / option to explore in this new setting. From a corporate perspective, there are growing numbers of smart partners, who can build smart proposals, and who can bring clear innovation to corporates. That's maybe something else to look for, how open your new situation is to looking for collaborative enterprise, how porous they can make their walls to innovation and possibly generative working partnerships. I'm interested to hear your further views on this!

@everyone The New Reward System is in full swing of praise quantifications and I am once again humbly asking for

**more Quantifiers**

to participate in processing all of the wonderful praise action happening in the TEC. <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f64f.png" width=20 height=20>

Quantifications are actively ongoing with new rounds happening every week! ‚ú® If you're a new or seasoned contributor I would like to invite you to participate in this crucial role within our Commons. Quantifiers will even receive TEC tokens (Retroactively, once Reward System is finished development) for their valuable work! <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1fa99.png" width=20 height=20>

Time commitment in the near term will be

, however many hands make for light work so we need as many members as possible to join our Quantifier Pool! <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f64c.png" width=20 height=20>

We're still in active development of the Reward System so especially in this moment, this is the opportunity to provide a

**simple and very meaningful contribution**

to the evolution of the TEC with your participation and feedback! To learn more about the Reward System (and the Quantifier's role) and how to quantify, check out this content - Rules of Praise and Quantification: <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f4cf.png" width=20 height=20>

Quantifications are actively ongoing with new rounds happening every week! ‚ú® If you're a new or seasoned contributor I would like to invite you to participate in this crucial role within our Commons. Quantifiers will even receive TEC tokens (Retroactively, once Reward System is finished development) for their valuable work!

We're still in active development of the Reward System so especially in this moment, this is the opportunity to provide a **simple and very meaningful contribution** to the evolution of the TEC with your participation and feedback!

I get in touch with @rex regarding data analysis task for #sampo team and we come to conclusion that It is best to find a member who know inner working of current token mechanism. description of what #sampo initiative is doing

"Sampo" is the Finnish mythic "Horn of Plenty." It symbolizes this working group's purpose: community wealth. We focus on financial management, income generation, and the economic development that builds demand for the TEC token.

does anyone want to do this data analysis tasks? does anyone know someone who would be a good candidate? Also, we still look for white paper. can anyone send us this please? Thank you in advance (edited)

Hello @Mr Arinze! I understand that you are looking for someone who is knowledgable on how to use discord to build/engage/moderate a community of users? If that's the case, different working groups might be of interest to you: -

**Gravity**

: They work on conflict management -

**Soft Gov**

: They are right now doing research into

*ecosystem health metrics*

and

*voter apathy*

-

**Communitas**

: They are in charge of community building. They are also working on the engagement process. -

**Labs**

: They are experts at using Discord as a tool. You can check their voice and text channels on the left. You are free to join their weekly meetings and check their work. I hope I was able to answer your question <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f601.png" width=20 height=20>

hi folks! I'm working through a concept for tooling + support + economics for decentralized science in the regenerative movement (aka a public good for fueling coordination in regeneration). I would love to pick a brain or two on token engineering principles and how to align economics of a system with its mission. Perhaps @Stewards or a @Hatcher might be able to point me in the right direction?

Hi everyone! I'm Melike, I'm a Sociology master's student at the University of Mannheim in Germany and I'm interested in studying DAOs and contributing to the design of alternative socioeconomic mechanisms. However, I need some help. I'm going to start writing my thesis soon and I don't have a specific research question yet. And the more I read the more confused I get about what I should do. I really want my research to be of some use to the DAO ecosystem and I don‚Äôt feel comfortable deciding what the needs of the ecosystem are all by myself so I thought I should just ask: what is a question that you believe will be beneficial to the DAO ecosystem when explored? It could also be a problem that needs a solution. I would appreciate any ideas or advice. And I would love to conduct some informal interviews with any volunteers as a way of preliminary research to understand the experience of the people that make up DAOs and the needs of these communities. You can either write to me here if you have anything to say, or reach me at mnazlikaplan@gmail.com. Thanks! <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f642.png" width=20 height=20>

Dear friends, the Crypto Commons Association is organizing a Hackathon early next month (3rd till 12.06.) in its recently opened Hub in the Austrian Alps, to which I'd like to invite your participation. The main aim is to use our collective skillsets and experiences to turn the (physical and virtual) venue into a prototype for non-commercial, place-based pluriverses. Besides that, we plan on having lots of fun social activities such as hiking, swimming, chilling in the hottub, and building a pizza oven. The first challenge is to build bridges between the physical space and its digital copy, a detailled 3D model that is envisioned as an extension of our lived reality. The second main challenge revolves around exploring the use of reputation systems, their inputs and the rights members may accrue based on them. please find further information on the event here: [https://www.notion.so/OURverse-the-Hackathon-c5486710033e4446befcd6b82a7d333a](https://www.notion.so/OURverse-the-Hackathon-c5486710033e4446befcd6b82a7d333a)

Hey there! This message is me in a year since i am also starting a sociology masters and want to combine it with the web3/DAO work i am doing. I think you can look at this from many angles with a sociological lens. Such as, sociology of organizations, socio economical or cultural anthropology/sociology. I would like to maybe exchange some topics if you want. I have been in the DAO space for about 4 to 5 years so could help you get some clearity. (re @geleeroyale_bot: melikekaplan Hi everyone! I'm Melike, I'm a Sociology master's student at the University of Mannheim in Germany and I'm interested in studying DAOs and contributing to the design of alternative socioeconomic mechanisms. However, I need some help. I'm going to start writing my thesis soon and I don't have a specific research question yet. And the more I read the more confused I get about what I should do. I really want my research to be of some use to the DAO ecosystem and I don‚Äôt feel comfortable deciding what the needs of the ecosystem are all by myself so I thought I should just ask: what is a question that you believe will be beneficial to the DAO ecosystem when explored? It could also be a problem that needs a solution. I would appreciate any ideas or advice. And I would love to conduct some informal interviews with any volunteers as a way of preliminary research to understand the experience of the people that make up DAOs and the needs of these communities. You can either write to me here if you have anything to say, or reach me at mnazlikaplan@gmail.com. Thanks!

I hadn't seen anyone reply yet, so I'd first like to welcome you to the group! I have been onboard for a few weeks and am actually helping coordinate the new TEC Writers Guild to help with TEC writing needs. I think a couple folks in that group might have good feedback for you, including prior works. They can definitely help you make more connections within the group to pursue the questions you have. Tagging a couple folks as such. @Gideonro @Gaian (edited)

That is always a good question. You landed in the right place to kick off the conversation so I am hopeful that my drawing more attention to it will provide a nudge in a good direction. FWIW, I am very new and have been involved in a number of inspiring conversations about onboarding new members and how good long term engagement requires novel solutions in this new world. That may be an area to look at and see if there is a particular facet of interest.

Wassup token engineers! the Crypto Commons Association is organizing the OURverse Hackathon from 3rd to 12th of June to turn its Hub in the Austrian Alps into a prototype of a place-based Pluriverse. Tickets and accommodation are for free! While the first challenge revolves around building audio-visual and other bridges between the physical place and its VR copy, the second challenge is to throw social coordination technologies at social situations in the house and see what sticks. I'd love to see many of you participate and bring with you the great experience this community has with praise/reputation systems etc! Please find all info here: [https://www.notion.so/OURverse-the-Hackathon-c5486710033e4446befcd6b82a7d333a](https://www.notion.so/OURverse-the-Hackathon-c5486710033e4446befcd6b82a7d333a) the association: [https://www.crypto-commons.org](https://www.crypto-commons.org/) Tomorrow 3pm CET we will also have a twitter space for open questions etc: [https://twitter.com/CCommonsHub/status/1526900334412673024](https://twitter.com/CCommonsHub/status/1526900334412673024)

Hello friends, there is a Blockchain course under the USA-based Clarusway. Clarusway is an education company that has been managing this process in the IT industry for years and has hired thousands of people. The Web3 team includes people from the Berkeley Blockchain Community Team. In the course content, there are 2 different sections, namely Web 3 Development and Blockchain Technology, and you can enroll in whatever you want. The course allows you to start from scratch and get to the level of employment, then provides CV preparation, interview support and networking. A 15-day trial period is given, you can contact with me.

Also do you have a 1 line tagline? Let me know](about:blank#)

Partial Common Ownership (PCO) is a new system of property ownership inspired by the ideas in Radical Markets. It is both ethically fairer and economically more efficient than the systems of property espoused by capitalism (private-ownership) and communism (public-ownership).

_08-Jun-22 02:49 PM_:

Great! The technical install is quite straight forward if you like to host it yourself. Praise is open source. See setup instructions here: [https://givepraise.xyz](https://givepraise.xyz/) The part that we call the "cultural setup" is a slightly longer process and it is not well document yet. Setting up a reward board, recruiting quantifiers, analyzing the data, etc. We will add docs about this to the website over the coming months after we help the first few communities get set up. For those, we offer the technical and cultural setup as a service, a guided process where we support them over the course of a few weeks. Which DAO would you like to use Praise with?

Gm. Not sure if this is token engineering related. Anyone working on or heard of any projects that is trying to solve the ‚Äúuser data‚Äù problem? Loosely related to what Vitalik recently wrote about ‚ÄúSoulbound NFTs‚Äù. For example, health data, work or project experience/involvement data, education/learning/certification data etc?

With the general market anxiety, I find the talent in DAOs like TEC very reassuring, and at odds with the FUD scare mongering in MSM.

Just like traditional economies, there is a core of talent, knowledge, experience, skills in #CryptoCommunities with intrinsic value, wherever that surfaces. Better transparency shows us the gap between true core value and market prices set by panicky trading. Onwards! 9/9

@everyone The time has come to activate your SourceCred account so you can get some of that sweet sweet TEC coming out of the Reward System! <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f4b8.png" width=20 height=20>

**If you have been or are active on the Forum or Github you should definitely be interested in this!**

I've created a thread -

**SourceCred Mass Activation**

- in this channel to carry out this process so we don't spam the #üé´ÔΩúgeneral channel with all of us typing in our activation commands! <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f9f5.png" width=20 height=20>

You'll need to do 3Ô∏è‚É£ actions to get this done: 1Ô∏è‚É£ Link your Discord to your Ethereum Address. We strongly request that you use the same Ethereum Address that you used to activate your Praise account for linking your SourceCred account. This is important to keep our analysis and transparency data accurate. <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f4dd.png" width=20 height=20>

If you're not sure of the address you used, you can type /whoami into discord and our Praise bot will give you all the info! ‚ùì To complete this step type in !sc save-wallet 0xYourWalletAddress where 0xYourWalletAddress is replaced by the wallet address you are linking and will receive sourcecred rewards to. <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f4b3.png" width=20 height=20>

2Ô∏è‚É£ Link your Discourse(Forum) account. Type in !sc verify-discourse YourDiscourseUsername. Where YourDiscouseUsername is your username on the TEC forum. The tec-sc-bot will DM you with the next steps. If you don't receive a DM check your Discord settings! <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f4dc.png" width=20 height=20>

3Ô∏è‚É£ Link your GitHub account. Type in !sc verify-github YourGithubUsername. Where YourGithubUsername is your username on the Github. The tec-sc-bot will DM you with the next steps. If you don't receive a DM check your Discord settings! <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f5a5.png" width=20 height=20>

Ô∏è Once you've completed all the steps you can review the information by typing !sc userinfo. <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f50d.png" width=20 height=20>

[J√ºrgen ‚Äî Today at 1:56 PM Hi guys! I hope all is well on your side! I came up with this code to and would like to use it as a policy update function (or call it in a policy update function); def new_location(params, substep, state_history, previous_state,total_population): if substep > 24 and substep % 12 == 0: while substep < 80: return total_population + 70000 return total_population + 0 How can I turn this code into a policy update function? Or how can I call this function in another policy update function?](about:blank#)

@everyone A reminder that the time has come to activate your SourceCred account so you can get some of that sweet sweet TEC coming out of the Reward System! <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f4b8.png" width=20 height=20>

**If you have been or are active on the Forum or Github you should definitely be interested in this!**

I've created a thread -

**SourceCred Mass Activation**

- in this channel to carry out this process! <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f9f5.png" width=20 height=20>

[https://discord.com/channels/810180621930070088/810180622165213218/987036751006666762](https://discord.com/channels/810180621930070088/810180622165213218/987036751006666762)

Review your sourcecred info before and after activation by typing !sc userinfo. <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f50d.png" width=20 height=20>

You'll need to do 3Ô∏è‚É£ actions to get this done: 1Ô∏è‚É£ Link your Discord to your Ethereum Address. We strongly request that you use the

**same Ethereum Address that you used to activate your Praise**

account for linking your SourceCred account. This is important to keep our analysis and transparency data accurate. <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f4dd.png" width=20 height=20>

If you're not sure of the address you used, you can type /whoami into discord and our Praise bot will give you all the info! ‚ùì To complete this step type in !sc save-wallet 0xYourWalletAddress where 0xYourWalletAddress is replaced by the wallet address you are linking and will receive sourcecred rewards to. <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f4b3.png" width=20 height=20>

2Ô∏è‚É£ Link your Discourse(Forum) account. Type in !sc verify-discourse YourDiscourseUsername. Where YourDiscouseUsername is your username on the TEC forum. The tec-sc-bot will DM you with the next steps. <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f4dc.png" width=20 height=20>

3Ô∏è‚É£ Link your GitHub account. Type in !sc verify-github YourGithubUsername. Where YourGithubUsername is your username on the Github. The tec-sc-bot will DM you with the next steps. If you get stuck check out my gist for reference -

I think it's definitely a topic for our next meeting! About the Active Gravitons label, there're 10 people in the server with this role. Maybe after the training finish we can review it and add more people

@everyone A reminder that the time has come to activate your SourceCred account so you can get some of that sweet sweet TEC coming out of the Reward System! <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f4b8.png" width=20 height=20>

**If you have been or are active on the Forum or Github you should definitely be interested in this!**

I've created a thread -

**SourceCred Mass Activation**

- in this channel to carry out this process! <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f9f5.png" width=20 height=20>

[https://discord.com/channels/810180621930070088/810180622165213218/987036751006666762](https://discord.com/channels/810180621930070088/810180622165213218/987036751006666762)

Review your sourcecred info before and after activation by typing !sc userinfo. <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f50d.png" width=20 height=20>

You'll need to do 3Ô∏è‚É£ actions to get this done: 1Ô∏è‚É£ Link your Discord to your Ethereum Address. We strongly request that you use the

**same Ethereum Address that you used to activate your Praise**

account for linking your SourceCred account. This is important to keep our analysis and transparency data accurate. <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f4dd.png" width=20 height=20>

If you're not sure of the address you used, you can type /whoami into discord and our Praise bot will give you all the info! ‚ùì To complete this step type in !sc save-wallet 0xYourWalletAddress where 0xYourWalletAddress is replaced by the wallet address you are linking and will receive sourcecred rewards to. <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f4b3.png" width=20 height=20>

2Ô∏è‚É£ Link your Discourse(Forum) account. Type in !sc verify-discourse YourDiscourseUsername. Where YourDiscouseUsername is your username on the TEC forum. The tec-sc-bot will DM you with the next steps. <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f4dc.png" width=20 height=20>

3Ô∏è‚É£ Link your GitHub account. Type in !sc verify-github YourGithubUsername. Where YourGithubUsername is your username on the Github. The tec-sc-bot will DM you with the next steps. If you get stuck check out my gist for reference -

[@everyone A reminder that the time has come to activate your SourceCred account so you can get some of that sweet sweet TEC coming out of the Reward System!  **If you have been or are active on the Forum or Github you should definitely be interested in this!** I've created a thread - **SourceCred Mass Activation** - in this channel to carry out this process!](about:blank#)  <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f4b8.png" width=50 height=50> <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f9f5.png" width=20 height=20>

Review your sourcecred info before and after activation by typing !sc userinfo. <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f50d.png" width=20 height=20>

You'll need to do 3Ô∏è‚É£ actions to get this done: 1Ô∏è‚É£ Link your Discord to your Ethereum Address. We strongly request that you use the

**same Ethereum Address that you used to activate your Praise**

account for linking your SourceCred account. This is important to keep our analysis and transparency data accurate. <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f4dd.png" width=20 height=20>

If you're not sure of the address you used, you can type /whoami into discord and our Praise bot will give you all the info! ‚ùì To complete this step type in !sc save-wallet 0xYourWalletAddress where 0xYourWalletAddress is replaced by the wallet address you are linking and will receive sourcecred rewards to. <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f4b3.png" width=20 height=20>

2Ô∏è‚É£ Link your Discourse(Forum) account. Type in !sc verify-discourse YourDiscourseUsername. Where YourDiscouseUsername is your username on the TEC forum. The tec-sc-bot will DM you with the next steps. <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f4dc.png" width=20 height=20>

3Ô∏è‚É£ Link your GitHub account. Type in !sc verify-github YourGithubUsername. Where YourGithubUsername is your username on the Github. The tec-sc-bot will DM you with the next steps. If you get stuck check out my gist for reference -

[https://gist.github.com/divine-comedian/81a6ee939dcf0ef4a4254def2c59ed4d](https://gist.github.com/divine-comedian/81a6ee939dcf0ef4a4254def2c59ed4d)

Maybe you are involved with Bankless, there's a lot of guild activity there ... Here in TEC there are Working Groups, and WGs work similarly, although it's a less formal structure. Guilds in Bankless have the formal remuneration and role rotation that truly decentralised guilds typically prefer. In SEEDS, by contrast, there are more centralised models, although I suspect more inadvertently. (edited)

Hi @kaleverse.ETH members of TEC get compensated either by a paid role that is established as a result of an approved proposal which has been submitted to our conviction voting governance gardens, through a process called Praise (ask me how to praise <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f601.png" width=20 height=20>

) that has been developed within our own ecosystem, or by participation in our discourse forums or on github via Sourcecred. Paid role contributors are typically compensated in DAI and the other rewards system mechanisms compensate with TEC tokens. If you would like a personal walkthrough each system and how to get configured for participation, please feel free to send me a DM and we will get you squared away

_05-Jul-22 02:12 AM_:
Thanks, yes, much clearer. I'd say pensions for freelancers is an obvious first step, saving for the inevitable day when we want to stop working. Also, tax, because that's going to be pretty confusing, and no one outside crypto wants to even think about this. But another inevitability. I would suspect that typical organisations could be independent personal pension plan funds, and tax specialists, but how many will have a toe in the Web 3 water? If the marketplace needs to be educated, <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f631.png" width=20 height=20>

, then typically Twitter is the place to do that. What size marketplace are we talking about? Because that would be a reason for practitioners to come and get involved. (edited)

There are substantial numbers of freelancers working in Web 3, who may need such obvious Crypto facilities as pensions and tax arrangements. Odd to ask an insurance wizard, maybe, @JamesJWYork , but you have some great circles. Might you advise any providers who are in Web 3?

Hey TECers! I want to talk about Web 3 design, in particular e-mail. Given an email typically goes to one person, or needs a bot to put an email into a communal space, and given an email can be very long, TLDR, do TEC want to open the door to email dialogue, or do we want to encourage group visible interaction, which I feel is much more Web 3....

Would TEC WG videos help popularise WG vision and mission, highlight key projects in WGs, and help recruit more folk in general to the TEC server ?

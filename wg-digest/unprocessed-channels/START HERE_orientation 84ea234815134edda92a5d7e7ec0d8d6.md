Hello TEC! Noob here - just got off the Wednesday AMA where I got a few sips of the firehose. My professional background is in marketing and operations for startups in a few industries, but I've been VERY excited specifically in the applications for crypto in the public goods sphere for a while now. If you're interested here's a write up I did on how public goods might be tokenized effectively: [https://medium.com/@paulglavin/tokenized-public-goods-a-new-store-of-value-83b91c53d436](https://medium.com/@paulglavin/tokenized-public-goods-a-new-store-of-value-83b91c53d436) Excited to dig into TEC and pitch in where I can help!

Tokenized Public Goods‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäA New Store of Value

What would the world look like if we stored the economic value of our public goods?

Hi everyone!

![https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f44b.png](https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f44b.png)

I just activated my Trusted Seed Membership the other day. Starting to look through the forum, discord, etc. A little about me - Most of my professional background is in banking, having worn many hats from a teller to regulatory compliance. There I learned how terrible the world of finance is and since have tried to support anything that helps level the playing field. I also love to try out all things related to money. I call it "creative financing" as sometimes ya win, sometimes ya lose, but you always learn. I have since moved to greener pastures and work as the state compliance manager at a multi-state cannabis company. That tends to take a lot of my bandwidth, but am excited to help where I can.

Oh boy, major life decision on day one!

![https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f602.png](https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f602.png)

I've spent last night and tonight going through some of the channels and the forum. Trying to sort through what is old and what is new, and going from there. Saw there's some voting to do, so I was going to check those out. Honestly, I am happy to help anywhere I can. I enjoy working through the chaos behind the scenes. I once took over the day to day benefits administration for about 1,100 employees for about 6 months - with no prior experience....that was one of my favorite roles. If its not too complex, doesn't require advanced (or sometimes remedial) education, I'm happy to learn as I work on it. I'm not the most tech savvy, but as a user, I'm decent. The last time I did any sort of coding was back in the 90's, probably in C++, so I would probably do more damage than good in that area. I could definitely test whatever is built though. I used to do UAT and regression testing on some of the banking programs.

Its ripe for QA testing, we want to finish ironing our the kinks this week and release it so the community can be the first ever to take the power away from the technocracy and design it's own economy!

If you can drop in at any point during that sesh we can set you at it and give us feed back

it will happen here in the Params voice channel

Hey folks. I just activated my Trusted Seed membership and attended an AMA session with Commons Stack last week. Very pleased to have found you

A bit about me: I mostly help people and orgs doing good things in the world find greater clarity and alignment so that we can bring that into strategy, communications, design, and their internal environments. I am a member of Enspiral and donate a little of my time to Seeds. This year I've been deep-diving into DeFi and DAOs and the potential of Web3 to shift our global systems and bring decision-making, commoning, and wealth into the hands of the communities and groups that are marginalised and harmed by our current systems. I'm absolutely fascinated by commons, and about 18 months ago spent six months working on this commons-based project:

_13-Jul-21 04:33 PM_:

Hi, I don‚Äôt have a full understanding of all processes, and have not joined any calls yet.. and this question might be a little too specific, but.. I was wondering if theres a general space for discussion and feedback regarding the systems already put in place, but not necessarily belonging to any specific working group. I guess my thinking here was a scenario where, example, if someone who was involved in the commons noticed something that might have been overlooked when deciding to implement a tool or function of the commons, that they felt could potentially cause issues with ethics or undermine the mission of the commons, and wanted to get feedback from others. Either to ease their concern by clearing up their misunderstandings or to get confirmation that the concern might be worthy of a proposal

_14-Jul-21 11:49 AM_:

Howdy @storypup! If I follow you, here's what I would say: You can definitely use what we call "sense making" as well as "advice process" to send out a message to folks in the community at large regarding exactly what you said. You could do that through the "general" chat channel or elsewhere. Another place would be the AMA if you wanted to literally voice your thoughts. That would be up to you - how you would want to communicate what you want to share. Eventually, it would probably make its way to a SoftGov call. And from there it could become formalized in some manner if needed and become a proposal for change, etc. (I'm being super hypothetical here. Maybe it's a small thing; maybe it's a big thing.)

Hello everyone, another noob here. Wanted to do a quick introduction to get comfortable around as I am researching the available content provided by the community. My professional background is in business development and investment banking/consultancy, and also I founded 2 startups, exited one. (agritech with circular economic approach). Currently I am devoting my full time to learn about token economics and mechanism design. I am looking forward to be a help around here and contribute to whatever I can!

Sure @Kojak , in short, we automated a short supply chain to buy fruits and veggies that regional farmers couldn't sell last minute, turned them into freeze-dried snack, powder and paste, then provided to processors/b2b channels/retail. In the meantime we would donate the inedible parts to upcycling or waste management companies. For example, we would produce olive snacks, and the olive stone we would donate to a company which was producing bio-filament from olive stones, then they would provide us with packages made from the exact bio-filament which was 70% (unfortunately) biodegradable.

_23-Jul-21 09:20 AM_:

With business development I think you'll be made welcome quite quickly. To note, it's quite often a little chaotic seeming, but also quite often a lot of work goes on behind the scenes. Understanding that with coherence is another step, and meetings take place that do bring some coherence, but it is not always documented at the same level. Interesting things like voting and governance come into play, and there are a variety of flavours going on. My interest is whether grassroots can be supported, because that would then be really different from banks, whose preference is only to deal with large transactions. Of course they have huge overheads, and I hope DAOs are seeking ways to minimise overheads, meaning some attention can still be given to grassroots opportunities.

I haven't thought about it to be honest. When we were doing our operations, it was hard enough to attract farmers to even use a supply chain management systems most of the time. I guess our model should be first tried to be applied to Food Banks that are partnered with food logistic companies.

He's gone a long way with his thinking, and it would be great if you could suggest some next steps for him. I appreciate enterprise is difficult, and he's pretty realistic, he's been chasing the dream for some years now, so he's certainly dedicated. He wants to push, and gets frustrated when he's stuck. I'll just throw this link in to show his work, so you can see where he's got to ... He might not even insist on tokenomics, he mostly wants to get it done as a better way for Palestine, you know all the other background that goes on there ...

We should look at Tokenomics and community tokens as enablers of both functionality and finance as a feature. Bring in mobile based apps, with tried and tested Arab based UIs and it becomes eminently more feasible. Am developing the concept of Local Level ( technology enabled) Circular Economies which are largely self incentivised. In the sense they do not need large dollops of external funding to be viable and grow. (edited)

This has emanated from a project under "Raising the Income of Farmers" submitted to XPrize in the 2018 Global Visioneering Challenge. In which me and my Israeli collaborator Fran Sorin were the global semi finalists. We did not reach the finals for some strange reasons.

Ooops...forgot this was the orientation section.

Hey @Suga ! Thanks for these great posts! Is it possible to pin a string or chain of them in this channel, say one post replying to another, replying to another etc to create the chain, and then pinning the last one of the chain in the channel, so we always have that reference? Or, maybe if you prefer, there could be a key resources channel, so folk always know where to look. This would save you from needing to post regularly, and you would then only need to reply to folks making enquiries ... Just a thought ... (edited)

Hey @innov8tor3 So, when you're here in Discord, if you look at the top right hand of the screen, to the right of the search bar, you'll see a pin logo. Give that a click. It's always worth checking in every Discord channel to see if there's a pinned message. (I'm not sure Discord looks on mobile because I only use Discord on my laptop or Mac.) I found this Discord explainer on YouTube that runs through how Discord works:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnYGrq95ezA&ab_channel=Howfinity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnYGrq95ezA&ab_channel=Howfinity)

FYI, we often repost these links in this channel during our Wednesday's onboarding AMA (Ask Me Anything) - which are at 6pm CET - so that our new members can look at them while we're talking. That's often why you'll see the same links repeated here. Plus, we like to repost regularly for any newcomers coming into our Discord for the first time

Hi @GCF and thanks for the message and question! We definitely have ways for you to jump in without tech background. Here for example is a "wishlist" (that I plan to update next week), where each working group is requested to submit somewhere they need help. You can contact the steward for any of the working groups to get involved (and even if the role is not what you have in mind --just reaching out to the working group is a great idea! There is room for you and your skills, I promise!). Also, we have a "for contributors" set of issues in Zenhub that can be grabbed by anyone. If something is unclear, just reach out to anyone marked in the issue. And if you are unfamiliar with Zenhub, we can also go through a tutorial!

Sorry for late reply. School is tough this year so tough to find time for a side hustle. :) Would love to chat. Maybe even a cuppa beverage in person!? I teach at Oakland Tech on Broadway and 42nd and live near the Grand Lake Theatre. After 4 most days is good.

One of the things we need to get right is knowledge management because KM is, IMHO, one of the major blockers to a more participatory economy/society. The best KM community I have seen is KM4Dev which is International Development professionals. This group is quite good as well.

I'm seeing a few good things, which likely will continue to get better. A great focus on education, understanding there are learning curves especially for new arrivals. Plus support through documentation and human steward, so most aspects are covered in principle, and then need to be monitored and in time adapted as evolution progresses ... (edited)

Instead of TEC AMA, we can say something like "Orientation Call" or "TEC Orientation". Appreciate your feedback!](about:blank#)

I guess AMA helps folk in the know to attend, and Orientation helps noobs. How about using both, for both audiences? Broadest on ramping using only two words!

Hey TEC people, is this the right place forme to pop-up a thousand questions?

Second, I want to share some news about our orientation processes. There is a new working group called Communitas that will be handling a lot of community management and onboarding, so if you want to collaborate with this front, or find something to contribute with feel free to drop in the Communitas chat (it's the last one in the working group list) We've been having the incredible support of @anna-marie and @Suga for the last few months, but they both had to step out of more active roles in the TEC for a while. So if you have any questions please contact myself, @Edu - TEC Steward. or @Tam2140 while we look for more help in the orientation and Communitas!

I'm currently working on a concept I call Blissful Living. The whole concept should help to solve 3 critical issues we see in the world now; - How we as humankind look at health and healthcare - How we as humankind can live more sustainably - Having the ability (especially for younger generations) to create financial peace of mind Basically I would like to change the way we as mankind live; more energetic and more sustainable. Since there's a real demand for housing in the Netherlands and in the UK (in the end I would also like to branch out to Germany and North America), I figured why not start there? Essentially the real estate will provide rental income. Additionally, some units will be tokenized and sold as investment vehicles for investors To help bring the change to a healthier lifestyle, I would like to create an online platform where; - Users, health coaches and advertisers can create their own profile Users and health coaches get rewarded with the Blissful Living cryptocurrency for portraying "healthy" behaviour (e.g. a health coach can get tokens rewarded for giving a yoga class, a user gets rewarded for following the class) I would like there to be one crypto currency within this ecosystem. The online platform will be available once people start living and working in the developed communities. Regarding the tokenomics I have the following in mind; - the platform users should be rewarded for certain activities on the platform - I would like the tokens to be tradeable on a well known exchange - I have a token distribution in mind where a set percentage of the minted tokens will go to the team, community, charity and others. - I would like to implement a deflationary token ecosystem by burning tokens with company profits I was told I should model and test the token ecosystem to be able know how many tokens I should mint for instance. Since I‚Äôm fairly new to the crypto world, I need help with the tokenomics set up‚Ä¶ Is this enough information?

@gene probably where i am useful is in documentation... even that's a stretch, however i can commit a couple hours a week to doing some documentation, and specifically if that relates back to code that would help get me closer to my goals

[https://democracylab.org/events/2021-hack-to-give-thanks](https://democracylab.org/events/2021-hack-to-give-thanks) i can bring a proposal here and i would like to start bridging more traditional web2 civic tech with DAO work

I absolutely second nic's comment; your opinions are of the utmost value without qualification, right now. And it seems from your comments concerning progamming, you and I are potentially in the exact same boat. I have ambitions to fulfill a role as a coder as well, but feel that my actual capabilities at the moment are somewhat lacking. I'm working on a number of different languages and tools to advance myself, but maybe we could collaborate and do a little learning together?

That's quite alright; we're just super happy to have you! Are you actively involved with 1hive? I'm actually an aspiring dev of sorts myself. That's awesome you're in to hackathons. I've joined half a dozen in the past 6 months or so but have yet to complete even the beginning stages of a project.

I understand life responsibilities taking over intentions I promise. A friend of mine called me Friday night and said he was getting evicted, so I've spent all weekend with him boxing and moving a household. Had quite a few other things I intended to do over the weekend if I'm honest, including welcome you

Hi, I'm doing some research to start a DAO among several nonprofits across europe and maybe including India. I initially envision token holders to be the organizations themselves rather than individuals - is there a precedent for such thing?

_07-Nov-21 11:07 AM_:

Hey @detactical it sounds like you‚Äôre talking about DAO to DAO collaborations - best practices for that are still being researched. PrimeDAO, Block Science , Commons Stack and other projects have been involved in it. There are examples of one org being a member of a DAO, in this case there is usually an individual representative that would be responsible for participating in decisions there. The direction you can take will depend on how decentralized you wish those orgs to be. So, would you want centralized orgs to collaborate with each other in a decentralized way? Or decentralized org to collaborate in a decentralized way? The later is definitely more complex but could have very interesting results

![https://cdn.discordapp.com/embed/avatars/1.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/embed/avatars/1.png)

detactical 07-Nov-21 11:11 AM

In this particular case it would be a group of traditional (centralized) nonprofits, some of which already have a relationship as ‚Äúsister organizations‚Äù

<h3>liviade <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/480023322080444427/5749f33d32f3d2bf7084c18540ead477.png" width=25 height=25></h3>

_07-Nov-21 11:11 AM_:

And then they would share a common treasury?

![https://cdn.discordapp.com/embed/avatars/1.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/embed/avatars/1.png)

detactical 07-Nov-21 11:12 AM

Yes the major use case is a shared, self-executing common treasury that could work internationally

So maybe 50 percent goes to periodic funding injections equally across organizations, 30 toward special projects the member orgs vote on, 20 as emergency funds in case one member org is in trouble

<h3>liviade <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/480023322080444427/5749f33d32f3d2bf7084c18540ead477.png" width=25 height=25></h3>

_07-Nov-21 11:13 AM_:

So that‚Äôs a ‚Äúsimple‚Äù DAO. The main challenge you will have is making sure all the people from the centralized orgs are aligned on the decisions they will make for the shared treasury

Simple because there is no significant token economics, correct?

_07-Nov-21 11:16 AM_:

No, simple was a bad word hehe sorry I mean it wouldn‚Äôt be so much a DAO2DAO thing, but one single DAO. But instead of individuals making decisions it would be a group of people acting as one to make decisions (edited)

![https://cdn.discordapp.com/embed/avatars/1.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/embed/avatars/1.png)

detactical 07-Nov-21 11:18 AM

Right. I only wonder about legal status of this supranational organization (the dao).

Being centralized institutions, the member nonprofits will have extra reason to cover their ass

Also if you have the right language for a stripped down template that would allow simple voting governance of a treasury by members ? Don‚Äôt quite know where to start

Thanks!!

Hi Token Engineering Commons, I'm Michael, a Kernel Fellow in block 4. I organize a weekly session on tokenomics for fellows interested in learning more about a specific token or protocol. In past weeks we have studied Olympus and Klima, Arweave, and Panvala, often with the protocols' founders as guests. I joined the Token Engineering Commons discord to continue learning about token engineering both to benefit what I am doing at Kernel and to help inform my work in local electric mobility, where I am a startup founder.

[Firstly, griff is awesome. Okay that‚Äôs out now so lets talk about TEC haha I work at gitcoin‚Äôs public goods workstream and I think we deal with many different protocols for the grant rounds. In my day job we work with different l1s and we‚Äôre one of those few web2 companies that accept tokens too. I‚Äôve interacted with a few folks that do mechanism design in college and i kinda miss this part of the world](about:blank#)

Nice, thanks for the thoughtful answer. First of all, i am going to drop our calendar, so you are aware of all the things that are going on right now ([https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=5mkep1ad1j860k6g7i7fr8plq0@group.calendar.google.com)](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=5mkep1ad1j860k6g7i7fr8plq0@group.calendar.google.com)). Also, for token design we have the parameters working group and TEC Labs for experimentation. Both are very interesting, just a note: all our calls **are open**, you can jump at any time, and every call have an agenda in case you want to be up to date.

You are doing a fabulous job at engaging the community, @Edu - TEC Steward. :D Yeah, Griff and I were talking for a long time in one of the Kernel sessions about the courage it takes to start a new field of engineering from scratch. Quite inspiring! I am also coming from GitcoinDAO, Complexity Weekend, Active Inference Lab, and MetaGov like most awesome folks here and just started on my Governauts journey yesterday with TEC. I also attended a Param Party where @Zeptimus and @Tam2140 kindly answered my noob questions. Way too many friends and too much overlap in all these worlds, so I applied to be a trusted seed as well! Really grateful to the folks from TEC who agreed to do two events with Gitcoin's Public Goods workstream in a week. The twitter spaces was a blast. We have one more with Griff today at 4pm UTC :)

Hey there. Thanks for your message. I knew about the work of your group from some time ago but never delved deep into it until I spoke to @liviade a few days ago after quite a long time. I‚Äôm planning to show up at the orientation session today. What is the best way to know how one can get involved to contribute? Livia told me about different streams and workgroups. I checked them out but it was a bit overwhelming to figure that out. I am interested in the parameters and soft governance primarily.

Hello everyone, I am new here. I am looking to start a farm and a bitcoin mining company. I have been thinking about how I could use the DAO as a way to get my community involved in these projects. We‚Äôre planning to grow all kinds of fruits and vegetables, pigs, chickens and beef. Also here in Gillette we live on top of a giant bed of natural gas that we would like to use for off-grid bitcoin mining. We plan to take the stranded energy and store it in the form of bitcoin which we can use later to build up a solar farm.

_22-Nov-21 03:42 PM_:

I really want to dig into the legal and policy considerations of keeping DAOs decentralized. How can we make sure that an organization won't attract regulatory scrutiny? Can we protect the participants from being treated as "partners" in an enterprise by their respective legal jurisdictions? I fear a situation where members of a DAO in the US (as an example) are ordered to pay taxes on all financial activities of the organization instead of just paying their share of income tax for money earned doing work for the DAO.

[I really want to dig into the legal and policy considerations of keeping DAOs decentralized. How can we make sure that an organization won't attract regulatory scrutiny? Can we protect the participants from being treated as "partners" in an enterprise by their respective legal jurisdictions? I fear a situation where members of a DAO in the US (as an example) are ordered to pay taxes on all financial activities of the organization instead of just paying their share of income tax for money earned doing work for the DAO.](about:blank#)

We are building Steer Finance, which is a keeper network for off-chain strategy execution for reduced fees but also allowing strategies to be built via various languages other than Solidity. Our first product will be support for concentrated liquidity management strategies with support for both Uniswap as well as the upcoming Trident release from SushiSwap. We are looking for partnership to discuss the reward system as well as governance system and distribution to those who run keepers or strategies for the protocol.

Steer Finance - Automated Strategy Execution

Steer protocol is a platform for cross-chain automated strategies with secure on-chain executions without extreme fees.

Hello, thanks for asking the question. And for your benevolence! After attending the meeting, I am not sure that I have seized all the opportunities that the project brings. Tokenomics are my daily life today, so I slipped you into my "to do list"

![https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f605.png](https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f605.png)

I wanted to know more about your product before I asked any questions, (and in the short term I'm busy), but seeing as you ask ^^ I understood that a dao can organize its bonding curve, however I have the impression that it is necessary to limit itself to buying / selling. and I do not know if it is a simple complementary tool or if your project is supposed to manage the whole of the offer. my curiosity is to know if the tools also make it possible to manage a currency which does not have its fixed supply, or which is not premine. For some projects, my creativity pushed me to choose that some actions of a protocol allow to have an inflationary action and others to burn. If the tool allows a natively centralized protocol to become fully decentralized a few months later, it's exciting, if the tool is only intended for natively dao projects, that's fine too, but will not cover not my medium term need.

We will be utilizing a special bonding curve, termed ABC, or Augmented Bonding Curve, to create our TEC token as well as further Commons down the road. Dr. Michael Zargham and the Block Science team were the designers behind this unique function and what serves as essentially the engine or ‚ù§Ô∏è of our token and its related economic implications.

Augmented Bonding Curve

The ABC is a modified token bonding curve that generates continuous funding for open organizations that produce and maintain public goods.

Is there something I'm missing re: connecting to the calls?

thank you gene! I was looking at the calls and wasn't sure which one was for newcomers exactly, but your suggestion helps! I've been more into the tokenization from the financial/economic perspective predominantly. I also just enjoy DAO "watching" i.e seeing participant behaviours

If you are into tokenization, then you'll definitely want to check out the Commons Config Dashboard and learn about Augmented Bonding Curves

![https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f9e0.png](https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f9e0.png)

I also enjoy DAO watching; the variations in the concept of "How to DAO" are vast and really interesting to note and observe.

The Dashboard is for creating the specific parameters that will be used in the upcoming "Commons Upgrade" for the TEC, but it allows for a fun and educational walkthrough of the kind of thinking that is required for building a community and a token at the same time.

Thanks for the orientation invite. I'm afraid I was lost. Didn't read the background required to follow along and wasn't able to find the documents being discussed. I was asked to sign a "doodle" and couldn't find it. Spent 20 min looking through discord and found the commons upgrade presentation here: [https://discord.com/channels/810180621930070088/810180622479917063/927985765953183744](https://discord.com/channels/810180621930070088/810180622479917063/927985765953183744).

_06-Apr-22 08:50 AM_:

Thank you for the call info! Gitcoin is a nexus of a lot of great projects poking at the future as I've come to understand it. Reading through links in their materials TEC stood out to me as an example of the human wrapper on the technology in play. I worked in software from 1994 through 2017 after which I launched a meadery/cidery which ran until Dec 2021. I had been a homebrewer/speaker/educator from the early 2000's. That info makes the huge transition (software to wine) much less of a ? I am not so much looking to be a software engineer, but use my knowledge of it, the process, the roles, organizational choices, etc around it to do something cool. Investing in crypto (new to me in 2021) led me to look deeper and I am excited about what I found. Cheers! (edited)

Hi all and thanks for the welcome and invite to the community call tomorrow. The Aragon proposal was called the Umbrella Proposal, which requested funding to pay for Graviton Trainings with TEC and to establish the Umbrella Team to deal with intra and external DAO conflicts. The proposal passed and the team has its first meeting tomorrow with trainings starting the end of this month. Hope I can make tomorrows call and get a better understanding of the TEC project.

Hi TEC! I'm Patrick. We (a two-person team) have been working to establish River Coop, a nonprofit social-environmental impact cooperative. We are now building out our infrastructure ‚Äî our token, gardens and a gnosis safe ‚Äî and learning a bunch in the process. We are moving (very) slowly, are not taking on VC funding and are building an app to enable people to build campaigns and to fund small and large initiatives. River will strive to become closely aligned with and in some way be beneficial to TEC and the 1Hive/Giveth/Commons Stack/TEC ecosystem. I read a "Treasury Management in Gardens" post on 1Hive's forum yesterday. It mentions that TEC is using wxDAI as a request token for your Garden. If this is accurate, it is something I have not considered and would love to know more. (Our token, SILT, will be a stable token. Basing it on DAI ‚Äì wxDAI for low fees ‚Äì makes a ton of sense. Maybe I can sit in on a sync call next week to learn more. We'd love to evolve into a supportive partner and contributor in some way. Thanks for what you do!

The short story is that I am part of Bankless Consulting, a sub DAO of BanklessDAO. In the team we are always trying to understand the most present needs among our customers and tokenomics design is one of the biggest ones so we started looking for training options in this area Coincidentally this weekend they also came up in a conversation with the Crypto, Culture and Society team (I'm a student in their program)

I know this is probably a basic question, but is the activate command: "/activate <public ETH address>"? And does it cost you ETH or gas fees to praise people? (edited)

Yes, pressing the command should be enough. And it doesn't cost any ETH! (We are based in gnosis chain, but the praise isn't happening directly on chain, the ETH address is for you to receive the TEC tokens)

Would you mind if I reached out to you individually with some questions, or just to offer you a 1 on 1 orientation call? I don't mean to shake your hand off at the door, but I'm just delighted to meet a friend of a friend here

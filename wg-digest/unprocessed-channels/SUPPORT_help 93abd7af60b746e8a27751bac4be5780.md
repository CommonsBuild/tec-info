Hey folks. I've been realising just how little I understand the specifics of how DAOs actually work, i.e. voting, and token allocation etc. The article @mitch (üçî, üçî) just put out on the forum about the hatch params is incredibly helpful but I still feel like I'm missing some basic knowledge about the tech aspect of DAOs. Can anyone point me towards some youtube videos that share an overview of DAOs and the structures and systems often used; and their relationships with each other? I'm a visual thinker who naturally maps out systems and their relationships, so I take information in better through videos and graphics than long-form articles. Thank you!

Did anyone help you out? If you ask me, the best way to learn is to dive in. Join one or two. Watch it in action. I don't spend much time on YouTube, so I can't recommend a video, but I can give you a not-too-wordy overview. The great thing about DAO's is the sky is the limit. They can replace your traditional businesses like a partnership or corporation, but they could also be a book club. A majority of DAO's today issue a token that provides you membership and potentially voting rights, but that doesn't have to be the setup. Some DAO's are set up by a small group that controls the very start of the DAO. They make some major decisions, what the mission is, the structure, and tend to retain a large share of the voting rights/token supply. Then its opened up to a larger group, often selling a token or rewarding a token (staking, airdrop, etc) Others, like the TEC, are starting with the larger group building out those parameters, putting things up to vote from day 0. As far as relationship with other DAO's PrimeDAO has been exploring how DAOs will collaborate. Recommend checking out their medium

I hear what you're saying except that's exactly what I have been doing - diving in and attending meetings and offering my time with small tasks - and, while I feel warmly welcomed, a lot of the terminology and concepts are so alien to me that it's like listening to a talk in another language, and I find that quite alienating and confusing. I do understand what a DAO is and does, I just don't understand a lot of the mechanics within it. Every new thing I come across here in TEC, like voting on the VMMs, and my first param party, has so much that I need to get my head around about the actual processes and terminology, that I'm craving some 'DAOs 101: Here's the basics' in videos and graphics. I'll have a look at the links you shared. I have been reading long-form articles when I have the bandwidth, and I know of Aragon, so I'll check out their site. Cheers!

I'm probably in the same boat as you - work consumes my life right now, so I often take advantage of a minute here, 10 minutes there, but never have the time to really sit go through it all. To be honest, I probably came back to this 5 to 10 times before I finished writing it. I'll tell you one thing - It took me a while to wrap my head around the different types of voting. Commons Stack [https://medium.com/commonsstack](https://medium.com/commonsstack) has some pretty good articles, and occasionally posts just a photo [https://twitter.com/commonsstack/status/1389939720260628484?s=20](https://twitter.com/commonsstack/status/1389939720260628484?s=20) that explains a lot. Make sure you follow their twitter. [http://twitter.com/commonsstack/](http://twitter.com/commonsstack/) If you want to get technical, as far as the systems, each DAO kind of pieces together the system that works for them. In addition to what you see here in the TEC, a lot conduct their voting using [https://snapshot.page](https://snapshot.page/), though I've seen discord emoji voting. There's also DAOhaus [https://daohaus.club/](https://daohaus.club/) which tries to provide an all in one solution. For fun I created my own DAO on DAOhaus - lets me play around at my own pace and I don't have to worry about messing anything up. DAOhaus also has their Foundations Program (Details on their discord [https://discord.gg/3td9U9jEaM)](https://discord.gg/3td9U9jEaM)) but I think its meant as an intro to DAOs.

Apologies for the confusing question! I am starting to play around with creating tokens on the xdai chain and was wondering if there were any tools to take a snapshot of a given token‚Äôs current address holders. (A list of all the addresses that hold a given token) Easy to do manually but there has to be a better way to do it! I hope that makes sense. Thanks for the polite reply!

Looking at tenderly right now. Any other ideas?

I had a few questions in mind on bonding curves: 1. Can bonding curves be capped with a fixed supply of tokens? Is there any model where bonding curves can be married with fixed token supply type of tokenomics? 2. Is the bonding curve the only paradigm to raise ICO? 3. When to go with DAICO and when to go with augmented bonding curves? 4. What are some tokenomics techniques to raise an ICO apart from Bonding Curves and it's variants like Augmented and Risk Adjusted Bonding Curves. 5. When does one choose a bonding curve, when does one choose augmented bonding curves and when does one choose risk adjusted bonding curves? 6. When does one choose cadcad for token engineering at which stage of the pipeline of creating your token?

_06-Aug-21 11:48 AM_:
I think it would be helpful for newly joining members to clearly see who's part of the onboarding team. It means that when we DM them out of the blue, they have the reassurance that we are who we say we are. We can also then be tagged via @onboarding in channels. By the way, when I say 'tags', I mean 'roles' - I just realised that's the Discord term! But you probably guessed that!

![https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f642.png](https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f642.png)

It's fairly easy to set new roles up if you're someone with admin powers.

_06-Aug-21 12:52 PM_:
You know, it's interesting... it's little things like this that I think move us away from being a truly decentralised org to something more like a centralised one, where a small thing like a trusted contributor seeing a useful improvement doesn't have the autonomy to simply make that improvement, or to know the simple steps they themselves can do to get consent (instead of checking in with a steward for the go ahead)

_23-Aug-21 10:43 AM_:

Do you by chance have more than one Metamask (or whatever you use) address? I ask because I created a new wallet address when I applied. Every time I went to an app where I needed credentials I needed to first open up my metask plugin and switch addresses. Then I went to the swiss thing and could see my funds for gas fees. Not sure if that's helpful but it's a thing to consider. Granted you asked this a while back I'm curious what the solve was. (edited)

If one wanted to propose something that does not already exist in the current architecture for TEC where might one do this... and where might one find examples for proposals past as a reference to create a new proposal. (maybe they're not called proposals it's just a term I know for such things, I understand communities all have their own customs around language use)

_25-Aug-21 08:52 AM_:

I believe it's just people showing their appreciation or support of that person being recognised. The bot only records that praise once so you'd need to make your own praise even if it's similar to someone else's. @iviangita is that right?

Yes! The Praise automatically gets a green check emoji if it has been recorded by the bot. Other emojis are just reactions from people

I guess my question was two-fold: 1) did the bot record more supportive emojies (no) and 2) does more emoji reacts influence the data collectors that assign value (i'm guessing also no because it doesn't translate to the DB)

Emoji reactions don't pull through to the spreadsheet used to quantify praise, so the people assigning value to the praise only see the description, not any reactions to the praise given

@Suga @Edu - TEC Steward. and I have an idea for a new onboarding process where we ask new members if they're happy to fill in a short survey to fill in about what kind of support they'd like from us, what kind of pathway they'd like to take as first steps, and a bit of info like their timezones. We're thinking of doing that via a Google Form, which can be pulled into a Google Sheet. What we'd really love is if that info could somehow be automatically pulled from the sheet and sorted, and certain info sent to each of us. To help save time and make our jobs more manageable, and us more effective. Is this possible? Would someone volunteer to be our magician when we have our form and sheet set up?

Hi @metaverde! I can see on blockscout that the address you shared does hold CSTK. Do you want to share the proposal link and I can try it with my address? (Anticipating I would have the same results as you). I think this is something the Gardens team would be best able to figure out. Looping in @sem(üå∏,üêù)

I would love to hear from your experience the ways we can make the internet more accessible. I learn by diving into docs, I only know to look out for what I've discovered in my travels.

Here's a HUGE ask. :) is there some one who could give me maybe 20-30 mins on a call at some point after 2pm PST? I am eager to build a trial DAOish for my HS with a few students. I am looking for the obvious mistakes to avoid to make something actually useful.

Hello everyone! My name is Bianca, I'm Brazilian and finishing my degree in Psychology. I started to be interested in crypto and DAOs this year. Now I'm doing the gravity training and it's being awesome! I would love to help somehow and also if someone wants to help me get started to learn more about even basic stuff, I'll appreciate it a lot

Adding @natesuits to the conversation. Nate, also in Oakland, and I met the other day. We are working on setting up a peer tutoring pilot on a test net to see if we can align incentives. Lots of possibility for additions like POAP and "badging" and diplomas etc.

Hi TEC, I organize a weekly tokenomics study group as a part of Gitcoin's Kernel Fellowship. Each week we examine one interesting protocol for an hour as a group. Part of the conversation is around a virtual whiteboard with a diagram of the protocol's tokenomics (flow of value, key actors and features) to help illustrate narratives of how the token or protocol works. We would like to make these diagrams very easy to create every week and have some consistency to them. So I was wondering if there is such a thing as a diagraming standard for tokenomics that we could use in our studies. If there is, I figured this community would know about it.

Falling down the TEC rabbit hole today + learning a ton. Will try to attend next week's orientation call. Few questions that I haven't located the answers to just yet: - Was there a maximum contribution amount of wxDai that Hatchers / Trusted Seeds could put in during the Hatch? If so, was it the same for everone? - Did becoming a Trusted Seed require BrightID? Or were there other / more steps to becoming a Trusted Seed? - Probably requires a longer conversation, but how will liquidity pools on other exchanges opening up affect the ABC? Really excited to learn more + watch all this evolve in real time.

I think that dashboad was set a long time ago (around 14/05/2021) and I think you joined the TEC around that time, so it might have taken some time to get your IHT minted, etc. leading to you not being in the dashboard's Predicted IHT results

Hi @BiancaGadelha For the moment there is no sign-up to be done. You are on our Discord server and praise to you are being recorded. They will be quantified during the first quantification of the new Reward System (ETA January). Around that time, there will be a process for you to associate your discord handle with an eth address so that you can receive the tokens.

We have had some folks here with a similar situation, have you tried switching to xDAI network? Some of the members of our community tried that and it solved the metamask issue. (edited)

I have tokens. I cannot vote because they are not aTEC tokens. How do I make them aTEC tokens? What's up?

Why Can't I Vote.

I'm going to say while TEC is friendly it is prohibitively difficult to vote here and there are far far far too many token iterations

I'm three or four tokens in already. Keeping up here is a full time job, but it doesn't pay enough for the time invested, and for not paying enough it's extremely hard to know when and how to vote.

I asked four days ago how to get the tokens I **actually have** into a form where I can use them to vote.

_26-Jan-22 04:25 AM_:

And the response was that the token is live. I gathered that when it was required to vote

Sorry to be so salty. I worked hard for the tokens I have, and the first couple of times I voted I could use 70 or so out of over 5000. That needs explanation. And the last time I tried to vote it said had the full amount, then when I tried to vote A I was told I had to vote the full amount and B I was told when I tried to vote that the tokens were the wrong kind.

THEN when I went to the help channel for help with a time sensitive issue like voting It took four days and the answer was non-responsive. I should be able to vote. I'm kind of not happy I worked hard, I'm still working hard, I have received ZERO financial help, and I CAN'T VOTE.

Like, I can't sell the tokens for what? A year? And i haven't been able to vote with them.

Why am I here?

It's tricky depending on how much ETH is. You can use the xDai bridge, or wait until you can use the ETH for a gas transaction (that it always comes handy)

_31-Jan-22 03:59 AM_:

my guess is that it has something to do with the us securities and exchange commission: SEC that has unclear regulations on what a security is. the above prohibition saves TEC from potential SEC legal issues while still allowing US residents to participate through a vpn, as there is no KYC so no way to actually enforce this prohibition

What does "Execute" do in the gardens conviction voting system? I want to vote for this:

CAUTION I was just told a vulnerability in the open sea api is currently being exploited

I suggest people turn off that option in MetaMask general settings until this is fully understood

It appears that an attacker is using smart contract 0xa2c0946aD444DCCf990394C5cBe019a858A945bD to interact with OpenSea's new exchange contract (v2) I am very unsure how this is working or what is being exploited but it seems that OpenSea's new contract is aboslutely rugged.

Hi @J√ºrgen! Glad to see that you are using cadCAD and want to share that there is a #help channel on the cadCAD discord server. Both @mZ and @ygg_anderson would probably love to help, I am sure, but have extremely limited time. You will find people in the cadCAD community that should be able to help you troubleshoot this error you are receiving!

Hi guys, I am exploring the possibility to build a token ecosystem for a mobile app about CO2 gas emission. **Which documentation would you recommend** for me to start designing it in a sustainable and ethical way ? I am thinking this project needs at least two tokens : one token to raise funds (probably a governance token), and token(s) to handle rewards - infinite supply. (edited)

Also we have to choose a blockchain for those tokens, and I am wondering if Gnosis Chain is the right choice. I guess it all depends on the needs/specs (edited)

_16-Mar-22 07:58 AM_:

Hello Sinan! Thanks for sharing. I think the needs/specs is what helps determined the answer to this questions. There is no easy answer for any of both. It depends if the sustainable and ethical way is for the mobile app, or the community around it, or for the developers, etc. So it's a tricky question. I recommend you to join the 360 session of Token Academy, where they will be discussing differennt Token Economics cases.

So...I have an ecosystem where users will be rewarded with tokens once they have accumulated engagement points. These tokens could be bought with business profits. The thing is though... How do I model and simulate something like 'token price' when I have no idea how the price will evolve over time?

Hello Jurgen! How have you been? Sorry for the delay answer. The token prize, at least on our case, is based on the community consensus regarding the parameters around the token and of course, the market. But there are many variables. We don't provide usually technical advice, you can take a look at our debates on youtube, on how we propose different set of parameters for our token. But otherwise, I would suggest you to join any of the TE courses available, mainly because the answer of this kind of questions have to be framed in a context in order to have a proper answer.

I'm working on a complex revenue modeling project for Bloom Network, where there are multiple revenue streams that each potentially have a different split to different actors in our ecosystem. Would this be something I could run through CADCAD? Our token model itself is light years simpler than this and doesn't need simulation. (There are local Bloom DAOs that together form Bloom Cooperative, and Bloom International which is basically a local Bloom DAO whose local domain is global, which is the platform maintainer for the coop).

It may be useful to some. I don't know you guys working style, but I like the idea of having a working group for different time zone. similar to TCE 360, but for team working together. (working across team should be quite seamless in this case) also I don't know what should goes into forum or support channel. If I misuse channel, please warn me. Thank you in advance.

Hi. I get really disoriented with the events. I need some help. I see the events here and there is the google calendar. They are not the same. I added the calendar to mine and there I have one hour for the event. But if I see it here, I see another hour.

what is the relationship between "common stack" and TEC? is "common stack" an accelerator program similar to "The Seed"? edit: If I understand correctly, "common stack" to TEC is similar to relationship of pip to python, a collection of libraries. In the case of cadCad, libraries are about simulation for TE.  (edited)

Commons Stack is an organization developing an open-source design framework for creating Commons. Commons are economies that reward value creation where business models fail to so. The Commons Stack is responsible for building out the baseline technical and cultural processes associated with Hatching a Commons. The Token Engineering community is utilizing this product in order to launch the Token Engineering Commons (TEC).

Hi @Anak! We can say that we completed these phases with the TEC deployment and now we are restarting the process through the Commons Prize. The Commons Prize was designed to select the next community that will apply our cultural and technical patterns to become a Commons (our next Commons). Here you can find general information about the Commons Prize:

[https://medium.com/commonsstack/announcing-the-commons-prize-d3df343c37a9](https://medium.com/commonsstack/announcing-the-commons-prize-d3df343c37a9)

The voting process to select the finalists has started, our Trusted Seed members will vote and decide the finalists and the winning community too. I would like to personally invite you to join our Trusted Seed Lounge calls on Tuesdays at 12 pm EST so you can ask more questions and learn more about Commons Stack and the Trusted Seed!

Hi guys I'm trying to use the /praise function in the praise channel, but keep getting add recipients again and again even after adding the praise recipients. What am I doing wrong?

_10-Jun-22 10:19 AM_:

Hi sagitario =) you can type "/praise" and hit enter

that will bring the window from something like this..

to this..

![https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/810180622165213214/984824469258383450/Screenshot_237.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/810180622165213214/984824469258383450/Screenshot_237.png)

with the cursor inside the "receivers" box, you can type the @ followed by the name of whoever you are praising like..

![https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/810180622165213214/984824995408662538/Screenshot_238.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/810180622165213214/984824995408662538/Screenshot_238.png)

from there you can tab over to the "reason" box, or click within it, and type out your reason like..

![https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/810180622165213214/984825507713536010/Screenshot_239.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/810180622165213214/984825507713536010/Screenshot_239.png)

then hit enter and you have made somebody feel good while rewarding them with some TEC.. =D pretty cool, huh?

The problem I was having was actually because I was trying the praise function on the Discord mobile app. Tried everything and it didn't work until I logged on to Discord on my PC. I suppose this means the praise function doesn't work on the mobile app? (edited)

And thanks for your reply

I can‚Äôt possibly onboard and transfer around enough crypto in the next 24 hours to pay my Trusted Seed dues. I haven‚Äôt updated my kyc with Coinbase and being in Seattle my ramp options are limited. Neither Kraken nor Bittrex allowed me access after updating kyc when I moved to Seattle after being divorced and frankly I gave up trying. Will I lose voting rights and access to my TEC if I can‚Äôt get 450 xDai to the appropriate contract within the next 24 hours? I only just got the message from @iviangita. I haven‚Äôt looked at a wallet or opened my computer since April, maybe earlier, instead focusing on irl now that lockdowns are over in Seattle. I‚Äôm attending LOCAL blockchain meetups, reading up on bonding curves, and working out models to test tokenomic theories. But atm I find myself completely unable to open my laptop. (edited)

I completed several Scaffold-Eth speedrun challenges and was inducted into BUIDLGUIDL. (edited)

But I just can‚Äôt crypto right now.

Hey Metaverde, you will lose access to your $TRUST (previously CSTK) but NOT to your $TEC if membership renewal isn't done before the deadline. But don't worry! Your TRUST score will be kept in the Trusted Seed database and will be integrated back into your account whenever you re-activate in the future

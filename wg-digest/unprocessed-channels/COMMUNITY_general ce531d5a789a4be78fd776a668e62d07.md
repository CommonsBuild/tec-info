Thanks @Unknown , @Unknown - I understood the concept of the multi-sig.. but I am not an expert in the area, so I have a few questions.. for example - how does approval by the majority happen? (Is it automatic within milliseconds/ seconds)

To give you the context, we are looking at a deployment that will be used by an arbitrary and geographically diverse population..

In the Bitcoin world (that's where primitive my knowledge of crypto ends

![https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f626.png](https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f626.png)

), the consensus is achieved by democracy of computational power of nodes around the world.. One would need crazy investment and crazy computational power to game the system..

how is consensus achieved in other crypto's for example?

Same model?

_25-Mar-21 03:23 PM_:

@Unknown then again our project isn't 100% decentralized because we're ultimately converting to fiat and sending money to debt servicers on behalf of users, so there is that grain of salt tokenholders will have to accept.

so ideally we'll need to instill trust in our tokenholders while earning the benefit of the doubt that funds will converted to usd and serve a purpose.

He is a top gun in the professional realm of bank note design. It might be that the fiat you hold (if any) was designed by him!

![https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f61c.png](https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f61c.png)

He is very interested in contributing to the community currencies domain, with a design that makes people feel they are holding a real currency which is not easy to forge. I introduced him to TEC and to The Commons Stack. I hope the community currencies in here can welcome him. Now I will send him the invite to join the channel.

IndependentCurrencies BOT 29-Mar-21 06:23 AM

Hi everyone, quick introduction: I've been in the currency design space since 2009. I actually started by working on community currencies in the United Kingdom, which exploded in popularity during 2009-2016. Through this work, I was headhunted by the banknote industry, designing and printing paper money, certificates, government documents and IDs for central banks and govs around the world. After I left the industry in 2017, I continued this work independently. I'm now engaged full time in projects for private currencies, collectibles, and artworks.

Outside of that, I've been an artist in the cryptoart/NFT space since 2019. The first artwork I tokenized was in fact a banknote design: [https://twitter.com/CurrencyDesign/status/1371831430574186497?s=20](https://twitter.com/CurrencyDesign/status/1371831430574186497?s=20)

Very nice! (re @IndependentCurrencies: Hi everyone, quick introduction: I've been in the currency design space since 2009. I actually started by working on community currencies in the United Kingdom, which exploded in popularity during 2009-2016. Through this work, I was headhunted by the banknote industry, designing and printing paper money, certificates, government documents and IDs for central banks and govs around the world. After I left the industry in 2017, I continued this work independently. I'm now engaged full time in projects for private currencies, collectibles, and artworks.)

I do all my project work through Indpendent Currencies: [https://www.independentcurrencies.com/](https://www.independentcurrencies.com/)

We work with projects that range from pure cash, to cash-blockchain hybrid products, to pure digital currencies with a visual component (I.e. NFT metadata).

I'm in touch with all the main chip manufacturers and I have contacts in the banknote industry, so there's a lot of knowledge to draw on. Hopefully I can add some value here.

You make a point about creating a face - this is essential. Most project fall victim to poor design that doesn't engage the public. Over and over, I see experimental projects look haphazard in their design - I can definitely help with making things look better, and more credible

Awesome! It took about a week before I was invited to become a member. Once you're invited, you'll have to pay the dues. It's $450 in Dai and on ETH mainnet so be prepared for a high gas bill. They do have scholarships if you need.

We had a bug earlier today that Wesley already fixed and we lost some of the votes that were there before unfortunately. So for everyone who voted in the past few days it's nice to take a look one more time and vote again. The great part is that new proposals will receive a fresh look

The value/quotation of $UBI and its conservation, in my opinion, is a critical and clearly essential point within the concept of universal basic income, since if it doesn‚Äôt comply with the main premise of serving as income (both because the currency is not accepted for normal transactions OR because it has a very low ‚Äútransactional‚Äù value compar...

UBI and Community Currencies have such a huge body of knowledge, there have been so many experiments and studies. I'm guessing the discussions revolve around "tip of the iceberg issues" and there's no true knowledge exchange between projects.

When the underlying problems are structural and incentives are skewed (I know this from experience in energy sector), and the participants of the tokenized network are still reliant on that structure e.g. living taxes (or grid connection), a well designed token is not the leverage point. It's empowering each individual participant. It's coming up with hacktivism.

Learning quite a big deal myself in the Invisible Economy. When you focus on all else what makes up communities and what it means to be human, and connect around those values, it becomes clear that a safety net/universal basic "income"/community currency becomes a corollary, a consequence

DeFi Safety wants to design a token! We are asking for resources as we start our journey (writing stakeholder incentives, etc). We are a bit unique. We will offer services to users and act as a bit of a public/private institution that will keep strictly independent from the protocols we rate. Anything I should read?

Come to a Hatch party and have the experience of setting parameters and discussing second order effects

Pre-Hatch Impact Hours Distribution Analysis

Hey Guys, I think I need a little guidance regarding TEC. I read through the forum and kept an eye on the different discords (Commons stack; TEC and TE) for a couple of days. I have the following questions: 1. What is the difference between the Commons STack, TEC and TE? I am not sure which one I should follow and engage with for what purpose 2. I have a genuine interest in both the Tech Stack and the Organisation you are trying to build. It is something what I was looking for for many years. How can I contribute with my profile 3.I am interested in the processes and tech for a project of my own and need a sparring partner to discuss the use of each aspect and tokenomics. How could I find this type of "tandem partner" I can have chats with to improve my idea/approach? Thanks in Advance! (edited)

_12-May-21 10:36 AM_:

hey Jantanner! Thanks for your questions, I'm not sure where this is being bridged from, not from telegram, hope you see this message. 1. The Commons Stack has a set of cultural and technical components, and the TEC is the first Commons to use them in its design. So you can say the Commons Stack is supporting the TEC deployment, but the TEC is an independent organization deploying itself. Token Engineering is an interdisciplinary field of economic design and the Token Engineering Commons aims to advance this field through a self governing social and economical body. You can read our vision, mission and values here, it will be easier to understand everything :) [https://app.gitbook.com/@token-engineering-commons/s/tec-handbook/what-is-the-tec/mission-vision-and-values](https://app.gitbook.com/@token-engineering-commons/s/tec-handbook/what-is-the-tec/mission-vision-and-values)



2. We have an incredible calendar with so many fun events you can get involved with, all our calls are open. Also feel free to DM @Suga to understand the best ways you can collaborate based on your interests. 3. For the project, I suggest you share about it in the advice process section of the forum so we can all look at it and give you feedback and help you craft it as a proposal for the TEC if in scope. [https://forum.tecommons.org/c/proposals/pre-proposal-phase/14](https://forum.tecommons.org/c/proposals/pre-proposal-phase/14) Feel free to ask us any questions about all this info, I know it's a lot to take in at first

How much votes is "ok" to add for a proposal? I put in 10 votes.

I would suggest leaving some votes for later after coming to some of the debates and seeing some more data compared. But by the end of it, use all your votes!

One big thing is we wrote a function to clean the inconsistent date formatting (some US, some EU). Also to create a directed networkx graph with users = nodes, praise = directed edges.

@ygg_anderson @griff (üíú, üíú) @JessicaZartler I have updated my fork of ygg's repo to standardize the "Room", "To", "From", and "Date" data. I didn't touch any of the quantitative features -- I also didn't drop any "na" or "dup" values since different people have different preferences on how to deal with these kinds of values. It may be helpful to other teams to start here or use some of it. (edited)

It's here: github.com/andrewpenland/praiseanalysis

The new files: "cleaned-non-quantifier-data.csv" is the end result. "cleaning-praise-data.ipynb" is the process. Hope it helps.

_06-Jul-21 03:21 PM_:

That page looks really great! I think maybe the Add to Calendar text that appears when hovering can perhaps have accessibility issues(less readable in cases), due to the presence of similar colour behind it? I also had another question with regard to the calendar links: Would it be of utility split up the links provided by each of the WG into a calendar that only contains the schedule for that working group? I think in current context, what if someone only wants to add the Gravity WG schedule to their calendar? (I think maybe we can set up calendar mirrors or something for each working group *though it might be too much work) (edited)

Hey TEC masterminds! Metagame is conducting an active recruitment campaign for our aligned communities DAO ecosystem. That means we are telling HackMoney participants about your community, your values and why they should join! Why are we providing such an awesome service for your community without any quid pro quo? Because our mission is to change the way people coordinate around solving problems and creating value! We are making the mission of Metagame true; by supporting the organizations that create value for everyone. If we were a corporation we would have to very closely make sure that this project *doesn't* create value for other orgs. We are creating value for you; because you are creating value for everyone with no strings attached either. Also we created a POAP called "MetaPass" for these verified HackMoney participants. The POAP event ID is 3873 if you want to use it to streamline onboarding, authentication and permissions. If you have any specific preference for skillsets please let us know! Do you need UI/UX, podcast personalities or writers? Do you have a specific stack that you're working with?

Please watch for them. This is my working document on who I've contacted. I'd love updates when people join. I don't think this is creepy?

From the discussion, and the previous discussion with Griff, here's a forum topic discussing the changes to the discord onboarding process.

New Discord Onboarding Journey

Why are we changing the process? There are multiple issues in the current onboarding, which have been discussed on, and some of them have been solved, but some remain. The main problems are: Spam Bots: Even though these pop up like once every 2 weeks, banning all of them can be slightly annoying, moreover if someone relatively new to the commu...

Greetings

**Token Engineering Commons**

! We're proud to announce to all of you lovely Commons Builders that Giveth has officially launched Giveth TRACE into post-beta status! Some of you may already be familiar with Giveth TRACE for Commons Stack contributor rewards and scholarship requests.

Do you ever wonder what happens to your donations after you give to a charitable cause? In the early stages of Giveth, we set out to demystify philanthropic contributions to nonprofits by empowering Givers with the ability to see where and how their donations are being used.

>

Finally, the time has come to introduce a platform that lifts the veil between Givers and their donations in action. A platform that empowers projects to create highly customizable online representations to attract real supporters. A platform that emphasizes the development of trust between all parties ‚Äî the Givers, the projects and the greater community.

Thanks to the TEC for supporting Giveth and the future of Giving! - Visit Giveth TRACE now -

Just like what @Suga said in the orientation channel, this weeks AMA is cancelled due to many members being at EthCC. But it‚Äôs okay cause now you can spend time reading more about TEC (check out the links in the orientation channel) and then gathering questions for next week‚Äôs AMA!

Thanks Justin. This looks possible. If we do have access to a group Miro, that would be preferable - I know there're other TEC Miro boards out there, so that means people don't have to learn to use a new tool. Plus, I might need more than three going fowards.

6PM is the correct time I think. That's when we had it 2 weeks ago. Which channel did the chat bot say it was 4pm?

Hi @gav and welcome to the TEC! Happy to have you here! Many of us here are big fans of the Bankless crew. I‚Äôd love to help you find what you need. If you‚Äôre looking for something specific we can try to make specific suggestions but more generally are you already familiar with the work of @mZ @JeffEmmett and @shermin ? I am looping in @JessicaZartler who always has great suggestions to share.

Oh, OK. I hadn't seen that. Well, again, if we do have Miro that would also be best for me since I then don't have to use a new tool!   @Suga Do you know if we have one? If not, might be a good thing to add to our onboarding ideas - a list of tools used by TEC, where to find them, and what options we have for each of them.

Hey @Mount Manu I see there is a great intention to create engagement there, but this sounds like a somehow harmful practice to me. I'm open to hearing opinions too but seems like other types of bribing could evolve from an innocent request like this. There is also a great effort to keep engagement organic and coming from intrinsic motivation. We were careful about this when setting up SourceCred params, and Praise carries a very genuine reward practice to its core.

[thread]: Had a look at this - and appreciate the way that they are explicit with code examples on the page - but.. please correct me if I am wrong here.. this looks like a *massive security hole* in particular if they substitute a different _msgSender address for msg.sender .. you better hope that the _msgSender they send is the 'true' sender.. cause if there smart contract gets somehow compromized feels like it would open the possibility of a compromizing a ton of downstream contracts which might be relying on _msgSender to secure all kinds of access rights..

This will likely be a time-bound process, and ideally we'll form a small task force to work on them. If you're interested (this could be a lovely first task here in the TEC), give me a

Hey lovelies

We're going to be bringing guest speakers into dOrg's bi-weekly community meetings, much as we often do at our community calls here. Would a TEC @Stewards be up for being one of those guest speakers? They're on a Thursday and we'd bring you in at 7.10pm so that you'd be ready to speak at 7.15pm, doing a 'show and tell' for 10 mins and then having 5 mins for questions. I know it's a really short amount of time but I'd love for the TEC to come and talk to us - perhaps you could 'show and tell' the dashboard, or an aspect of voting. It would be great to keep it technically focused as we have so many devs and engineers. They're every other Thursday from next Thursday 2nd Sept - be great to book you in for one of them! (edited)

From my boss and for those who think: "I'm vaccinated, why should I worry?": "I want to share what happened to my cousin because I can verify it to be true and I believe it may be helpful. I think she is around 50 years old. "Ok, here it is: I have COVID-19, likely the Delta Variant. I am double vaxxed. I spent the weekend ten days back with 9 other adults who were also double vaxxed ‚Äì 5 of us tested positive. We are all very responsible adults and were following Provincial guidelines in planning our gathering. I am doing ok and I didn‚Äôt plan on posting until I was over the worst of it. Everyone else is doing fine as well. Here is my plea! PLEASE GET VACCINATED!!! Thank you SCIENCE for providing me the means to only suffer a little of what could have been something horrific. I am very thankful that I was able to ride this out in the comfort of my own home and not in a hospital bed. Even though I‚Äôm vaccinated, I was still able to pick up COVID and was likely passing it on (as soon as we were notified, we did everything possible to limit spread as we headed back to Vancouver). I hope no one in my path was unvaccinated because I wish this illness on no one. This is a huge reminder to keep masking, washing your hands, and limit your contacts as we head into the fourth wave."

Hey Guys! Can I ask permission please? I'd like to ask two very skilled educators to come into the TEC Discord community, and I'd do a quick video walkthrough tour beforehand, so they know why they want to come and look at what is - for them - new tech. I'm thinking TEC are publicising the server on Twitter, and then the channels are open once folk arrive at the server. So it should be okay, right? If they like the idea, and they like the idea of tokens as a means of greasing the wheels, we could have a whole new form of education. And I think Discord think this too.

[thread]: I could see the Commons incentivizing this down the road (maybe they already do? I dunno) I was daydreaming when I switched a boost over about how server boosting would make for a good POAP badge.

_02-Sep-21 08:45 AM_:

Is there an authoritative source for digital currency or blockchain scholarship within academia? Consensys? I realize the model and institutions themselves are antiquated and don't/can't evolve at the rate of current developments, but it would be interesting to know who is even trying to bridge the credibility divide between yesterday and today.

I know @griff (üíú, üíú) received his degree from the University of Nicosia and they have a current program, just trying to find some potential overlay map of who is doing what.

I've been looking for a place to learn more about crypto related mechanism design

Don't know if there's anything more developed than the TE Discord

There may not be, it certainly feels like the intentions of this group focused on engineering the token instruments enabling ideal ethics and governance may be the tip of the spear

But I'm sure it's not the only source for scholarship or ethical intentions on the topic

The Double Edge Sword of Exclusivity

Financially-derived exclusivity or membership is a double edge sword ‚Äì it will succumb to the social token paradox. It naturally limits the size and potential growth of a community.

I dig it.

@innov8tor3 great call, we should update that praise message now. Every person who received praise up until 2 weeks prior to the hatch, (because there was a last quantification) and who activated their Trusted Seed membership before that deadline as well, will receive TEC tokens once the bonding curve is initiated. The praise dished after that period will be rewarded by the DAO once we are up and running after the Commons upgrade.

[thread]: I'm tracking that @geleeroyale had a bridge bot go down after discord made some changes. Maybe something could be figured out by observing the changes made to the operational one after discord did it's thang.

@innov8tor3 great call, we should update that praise message now. Every person who received praise up until 2 weeks prior to the hatch, (because there was a last quantification) and who activated their Trusted Seed membership before that deadline as well, will receive TEC tokens once the bonding curve is initiated. The praise dished after that period will be rewarded by the DAO once we are up and running after the Commons upgrade.

Ok so to make this BrightID seed group happen, we should make a group connection to each other (slider under my code). Then someone creates the groups and adds admins. Then we fill out this form. Seed nomination: [https://forms.gle/fCM9SRq8RmTCszjT6](https://forms.gle/fCM9SRq8RmTCszjT6) Once the seed dao adds us, anyone connecting to else has a better chance of getting verified. They do *not* have to join our group to get this benefit, just make a connection. The group has the seed powers so only trusted people should be in it.

Ha this is great. @griff (üíú, üíú) I imagine knows who the admins are For that part of the form. I haven't had a chance to speak with anyone there in realtime I'm curious about learning more about nodes and the cyber security aspect of it too. I'm happy to lend a hand in any way with doing some things with trusted seeds and brightID. I'd like to get sourcecred listed as a place that can authenticate too. I say fill out the form! I was going to scoop this under my wing but I'm just whittling along. I'm heading in to learn as much as I can about them I have questions beyond what the end product can do.

Hi! If you have questions about the Trusted Seed you can join our Trusted Seed Office Hours calls in the Community Hall channel each Tuesday at 12pm EST / 6pm CET in the Discord server that Kris shared or you can reach me or @mafer_cordovas. We are here to help you!

Hello @everyone! I just want to remind you to participate this weekend in the 75% governance giveback vote on snapshot! [https://snapshot.org/#/tecommons.eth](https://snapshot.org/#/tecommons.eth) This proposal aims to signal support for the funding and implementation of a technical solution that will allow to make governance tokens, and giveback 75% of the voice to paid contributors who had Impact Hours deducted previous to the Hatch.

Just wondering, do we have a curated library? So when a noob like me says, what is a definition for a Trusted Seed, then some simple reading can get noobs up to speed alongside the AMA sessions. Empowering the community to self serve / self educate will free up time to work on other community matters, I suggest.

Hey TEC people! I got a problem at hand and thought you might be the people with a good insight on it. I manage community for the JuiceboxDAO, and as we expand operation were starting to face difficulties in including America and Asia in the same loop for some of our governance and project convos for updates and brainstorms. D'you happen to have any smart plays to go around this without adding too much friction and inequality to the process? Appreciate very much any insight on this, it's been very enriching to follow your discussions and material in here

TEC consists of the most incredible token engineers in the space. Other very wealthy DAOs are desperately craving counsel on their token and incentive structures...

It feels to me sometimes a bit like the TEC community is over-engineering its own design params (the Hatch took ages and in my opinion in some aspects convoluted but ofc. with all the best intentions)

What if the TEC community began throwing its amazing ideas into the many DAOs that face big problems, and through that rapidly prototype. This wouldn't only create massive networks effects for TEC, but also enable rapid prototyping of the core stack and toolset that TEC is trying to build. Dogfooding only works for so long

![https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f436.png](https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f436.png)

and the opportunity here to help is incredible IMO. Also imagine how many token designers you might attract from those DAOs!

Hey Paul, in general think it‚Äôs a great to explore DAO to DAO governance and optimal token designs. My view would be to focus on technical and policy parameters for creating a configurable DAO-DAO ecosystem. Thinking in the vein of a TEC vision for a better Aragon and similar progeny that brings in best practices of token engineering and social impact.

_29-Sep-21 05:31 PM_:

Great comment! I'd think much more basic & less vision (as there's a lot of vision already).

ELI5: TEC is producing token and governance stuff. We need to validate that people want the stuff and use it - outside of ourselves. DAOs need the stuff. Let's sell services to implement the stuff to validate our core thesis.

_29-Sep-21 05:34 PM_:
For example, the Praise Bot is really cool! Why aren't more DAOs using it? Couldn't we easily help another DAO implement a Praise Bot to fairly distribute tokens to their contributors?

Paul these are interesting ideas. Thanks very much for sharing. I think this is a decent idea but most importantly it is totally scaleable. For example start with one smaller project. We must have multiple requests for help. Maybe our devs are maxxed out already.

yeah i would take this as an oportunity to re-structure the community call

my only concer on stage even if i support it coz i dont know how to scale the actual call

its that it takes away inclusion

stewards on stage and contributors on the viwer room

but our call cant scale tam did a timecode on the stewards call and 25 members means 1h being super strict with timing

_30-Sep-21 04:23 PM_:

Okay so I unlocked community mode in my test server and cannot see a way to share anything besides audio. It's just a voice stage from what I can tell.

You can send invites to people not in attendance without having to navigate around much seeking a link. and you can make the stage public so discord users can see that TEC is having an open call. May draw more attention to the Commons.

Oh an interesting project here, I wonder how many of these will iterate before the balance of social-blockchain is struck by some major project

Probably by engaging in a decentralized community that maintains a DEX or AMM. 1hive would be great, or sushiswap. [https://discord.gg/7d3AE9dQGw](https://discord.gg/7d3AE9dQGw) [https://discord.gg/JZyFtPMBwY](https://discord.gg/JZyFtPMBwY)

Are there any famous cases of apps selling tokenized assets straight through Apple's app store APIs?

Hello all. Does anyone know of a good solution for building an internal eth wallet into an app. This is mainly so newbies won't need to understand crypto off the bat, sort of like what NBA Topshots did. Would an open source solution be better than a 3rd party integration or vice versa? Also if this is the wrong channel for this let me know and also if you know of another discord group that might be more appropriate for this sort of question please let me know. thanks.

Here is something that seems to relate to "well designed online ecosystems" ... Draft text of the Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence is exploring framework for ethical use of AI systems, though no explicit specificity as to its application in decentralized structures. Would be interested to think around the ethics of AI and how well designed decentralized ecosystems may mitigate risks vis-√†-vis centralized systems.

_12-Oct-21 04:31 AM_:

I'm currently working on a concept I call Blissful Living. The whole concept should help to solve 3 critical issues we see in the world now; - How we as humankind look at health and healthcare - How we as humankind can live more sustainably - Having the ability (especially for younger generations) to create financial peace of mind Basically I would like to change the way we as mankind live; more energetic and more sustainable. Since there's a real demand for housing in the Netherlands and in the UK (in the end I would also like to branch out to Germany and North America), I figured why not start there? Essentially the real estate will provide rental income. Additionally, some units will be tokenized and sold as investment vehicles for investors To help bring the change to a healthier lifestyle, I would like to create an online platform where; - Users, health coaches and advertisers can create their own profile Users and health coaches get rewarded with the Blissful Living cryptocurrency for portraying "healthy" behaviour (e.g. a health coach can get tokens rewarded for giving a yoga class, a user gets rewarded for following the class) I would like there to be one crypto currency within this ecosystem. The online platform will be available once people start living and working in the developed communities. Regarding the tokenomics I have the following in mind; - the platform users should be rewarded for certain activities on the platform - I would like the tokens to be tradeable on a well known exchange - I have a token distribution in mind where a set percentage of the minted tokens will go to the team, community, charity and others. - I would like to implement a deflationary token ecosystem by burning tokens with company profits I was told I should model and test the token ecosystem to be able know how many tokens I should mint for instance. Since I‚Äôm fairly new to the crypto world, I <clipped message>

I would like to know how many tokens I should mint, at what price, etc etc.

_24-Oct-21 08:27 PM_:

Hey all, I am so interested in this space. I am much less into the academic and steeped in praxis as a software developer. In web2 we were told to move fast and break things, but this is obviously suboptimal for the web 3 world. I have been approached by a few people to help define their tokenomic model for a DAO and am working on making that process streamlined and productized. Obviously there is a lot in common with what commons stack is trying to do. Is there a place where I could reference an implementation of the augmented bonding curve model, or is it still in the theoretical phase? Sorry for my ignorance. I am trying to orient myself as well as I can in your platform, and signed up to the governauts course next month.

[thread]: Hey @Unknown | jgonz.eth, I'd love to exchange notes. I am also design a DAO and I have found that there is a tension in how to approach DAOs' tokenomics and governance. DAOs like FWB, BYAC, etc. have reached heights at such exponential speeds that there is almost a race to getting things out quickly ("move fast, break things"). That being said, I do think that there is space to experiment and not get caught up endless thought experiments and analysis. IMO, we are lacking a proper sense-making framework to understand where to move fast and slow in the DAO space. @solsista wondering what you're seeing, too.

_25-Oct-21 12:56 AM_:

Yeah in some sense I am leaning towards simplifying the tokenomics and then building governance tools for things like distribution, vesting, etc. I go back and forth on this though

Unfortunately but excitingly theres very little precedent here, which is what I think attracts me to this field

DAOs like FWB, BYAC, etc. have reached heights at such exponential speeds that there is almost a race to getting things out quickly ("move fast, break things"). That being said, I do think that there is space to experiment and not get caught up endless thought experiments and analysis. IMO, we are lacking a proper sense-making framework to understand where to move fast and slow in the DAO space. @solsista wondering what you're seeing, too.)

Yes simplify the economics, but "make it flow" somehow, anyhow...that's how you gather signals. But that needs the right community you want signals from etc etc :)) looking forward!

Thanks Eduardo. I notice you tagged Juan, but that folk don't tag so frequently in Discord, unlike in FB where it's needed to hear the signal from the noise. Am I best sending him a DM, or is the issue that everyone is just incredibly busy? Or do some folk work weekdays only and not weekends? (And I fully respect that, I'm similar, but I can poach some time early mornings!)

Yeah in some sense I am leaning towards simplifying the tokenomics and then building governance tools for things like distribution, vesting, etc. I go back and forth on this though

Hey all, I am so interested in this space. I am much less into the academic and steeped in praxis as a software developer. In web2 we were told to move fast and break things, but this is obviously suboptimal for the web 3 world. I have been approached by a few people to help define their tokenomic model for a DAO and am working on making that process streamlined and productized. Obviously there is a lot in common with what commons stack is trying to do. Is there a place where I could reference an implementation of the augmented bonding curve model, or is it still in the theoretical phase? Sorry for my ignorance. I am trying to orient myself as well as I can in your platform, and signed up to the governauts course next month.

Hello Friends! I recently came across a man who is looking to set up a large-scale thinktank DAO in the united States. He's looking to connect with and have a meeting with someone who has a good amount of experience understanding DAO frameworks, etc. Would anyone be interested in meeting him? He's an interesting, well-connected man, certainly worth the time of someone with some solid DAO experience.

never really sure where to put questions, but yeah, here we go. So I have noticed that those who give Praise have role assigned to them as a praise giver. Am I, new member, able to give praise when I am grateful for the work someone has done, or what does giving praise without the role assigned do? Should I be giving praise already, even though I am not a praise giver? Does giving praise remove the praise I have received (eg. a praise for a praise / ex. Lutzar has 2 praises, Lutzar praises memberX, Lutzar has 1 praise remaining)?

Hi all! Just wanted to articulate my journey so far, interest in what's next, and ask for guidance. 1. I walked in a while ago, courtesy of @JeffEmmett in Twitter 2. Interested in Gravity, Soft Gov, Reward Systems and Communitas 3. Taking the Graviton course, and loving it 4. Had a chat with @Tam2140 about forward path 5. Hard to attend all the community calls, which I think is a big barrier. I'm more an asynch kinda person, also having my own community based projects. Many, many good things happening here, just I'm not sure if I'm able to contribute in ways that work for TEC. That said, I'm committed to what's happening here, and would hate to walk away. I'm a fan and advocate of asynch working, and can show evidence of steady growth in that respect over some years. I do have projects I'd like to submit. Not sure which WG to go to with this.

Hello there! Nice to see that you have taken a path down the rabbit hole hahahah. I think you have identified the WG that you are interested in. I can think on many options: 1. Pick one WG call that aligns with your current projects and timing. 2. Pick one that aligns with something you would like to learn and syncs with your timing too (You are already partially doing with Graviton). 3. Depending on the nature of the projects that you have, it could be submitted for funding, feedback or support, so I would go wherever there is people who can relate to those projects.

_14-Nov-21 02:47 AM_:

From my friend Tibi in the Sensorica DAO, considering the value OS development provides to recipients ... "If we look at the structure of open source development, the reality is that most projects only have 1 point something developers on average, and most of these developers are not getting rewarded for their work, when in some cases the code becomes central to many applications. It happens often that some key code suffers for lack of participation and funding. Platforms like Github provide a better visibility into the ecosystem, but putting all open source projects on Github, a proprietary platform, would be a great mistake. It's already too large. So we need better ways, non proprietary, to map the open source ecosystem. NRP-CAS / REA would be something added on top of that, the economic layer. So Githab captures affiliation between open source projects and participation in projects. So you know that that code is a fork of the other one and these people have worked on it, are still working on it or have abandoned it. There is no mechanism to reward contributors other than external. Adding NRP-CAS on top of Github would be a great mistake, because you give this proprietary platform another dimension of network effects, the economic side of it. In other words, all the developers will put their stuff on this platform because this is where they can make a living. So we need decentralized platforms with NRP-CAS capability to be able to feed those who engage in open source development. This is precisely why Sensorica was created, but applied to open source hardware development." @JeffEmmett , I think you would appreciate the work Tibi does in Sensorica.

_14-Nov-21 12:02 PM_:

I would ask, what would you need for that solar panel project to work (related to us)? Do you need to have a governance consensus with other members? Do you need a token? Or you just want to create a community around the solar panel project? More questions could be relevant, but to identify how your collaboration could be reflected into this project (or any other), you should identify what's that you need.

Edu - TEC Steward.

I would ask, what would you need for that solar panel project to work (related to us)? Do you need to have a governance consensus with other members? Do you need a token? Or you just want to create a community around the solar panel project? More questions could be relevant, but to identify how your collaboration could be reflected into this project (or any other), you should identify what's that you need.

_16-Nov-21 11:58 PM_:

Thanks for your questions! Governance is always important, I have a stilted version in our Facebook Group, but it could be improved immediately once our project leaders in rural Africa have full web access. Even AMA sessions are difficult! Do I need a token? So much I need to learn, surely many factors to consider, where can I do that, please? Would one factor be proven value delivery? A community would be hugely helpful, since volunteers for the CSR approach process I developed would help accelerate process delivery considerably. (And community is another means of underpinning accountability and governance!) (edited)

btw i was talking to a prof about DAOs and tokens and he showed me this: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coase_theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coase_theorem) Coase Theorem When faced with an externality, the same efficient outcome can be reached without any government intervention as long as the following assumptions hold: 1. Property rights must be clearly defined 2. There must be little to no transactions costs 3. (Following 2.) There must be few affected parties (or else the transactions costs of organizing them gets to be too great). 4. There must be no wealth effects. The efficient solution will be the same, regardless of who gets the initial property rights.

Coase theorem

In law and economics, the Coase theorem () describes the economic efficiency of an economic allocation or outcome in the presence of externalities. The theorem states that if trade in an externality is possible and there are sufficiently low transaction costs, bargaining will lead to a Pareto efficient outcome regardless of the initial allocatio...

[thread]: Maybe you should reframe your initiative on the lines of what Peter Diamandis uses in his X-Prize/Singularity University backed themes which are based on a Massively Transformative Purpose (MTP) / and within the MTP an exponentiality releasing Moonshot. Token Engineering can lend a very powerful granularity to the concept, especially @Solista's pov that funding becomes a feature, if well defined. I redefine it as MTP <-> Moonshot <-> ABC. The true powerfulnes of this approach is it draws people to it, and there is no qui√ßk pivoting away to another profitable opportunity. You redefine or find another Moonshot within this framework. My initiative Local Level Circular Economies ( LLCEs) is closely aligned to what you are attempting. Except, when LLCEs are applied to village economies, the priority for me is food self sufficiency within the village itself. This becomes really important in the context of climate change, supply chain collapse etc. Education is a close next. And mobiles have to be powered through solar power. In India, Ela Bhatt a prominent social worker has created the concept of Anubandh - total self sufficiency within a 100 mile radius. We plan to begin with self sufficiency in food at the village level.

_22-Nov-21 07:13 AM_:

Because, LLCEs are sought to be almost wholely self incentivised, through innovative token economics, my focus is on diving deep into TE and building an Economic Model beneath the Community Currency. Because I focus on just one mission initially, the configuration space is reduced making modelling it extremely feasible.

Have been looking at Grassroot Economics, talked a bit to Will Ruddick, studying what Shaun Conway has achieved with IXO and my strategy would be to first test and implement the model in a few villages in Africa and then scale it out in South India, in the states where I could have the backing of the government.

Hello TEC

sorry if I ask about this here, but I would like to know if someone could help me to get funds from a smart contract I deployed :/

I barely know about solidity, but I still have the smart contract address

Hey I'm trying to research EverGrow and when launching their source contract on solidity test VM I get this error: Note: The called function should be payable if you send value and the value you send should be less than your current balance. Debug the transaction to get more information Ive made the constructor payable but it still wont seem to work, anyone know how to fix?

hi guys, have a question: if i understand correctly once the TEC token goes live it will be also transferable and tradable in crypto-markets such as Uniswap, correct? so it's price fluctuation will depend also on the overall crypto-markets dynamics, bull and bear markets, etc., correct? do i understand it correctly?

Yes this is true Vangelis. The TEC tokens will be minted in the Augmented Bonding Curve and any presence in secondary markets (assuming there will be) creates an arbitrage opportunity with the ABC.

Hello there! It really depends on your area of expertise. If you are a developer, I believe it will bring a lot of value to your work. Token Engineering has the system design part and the theory part. So you can either create tools that will be used on the creation of tokenized systems or you can research and propose for example, ethical and good practices that will be implemented. A lot of these things are new. But we are seeing how DAOs are starting to catch up. (edited)

The mission, vision and objectives of the token, the community building around the token, the cultural part that surrounds building a token. A Token built by developers only without any community behind it, is a strange thing, I believe.

Our incentive model, is education and learning, there are very few places were you can actively learn about TE. Also we have incentives models for contributors, through the reward system and praise system that will go live quite soon. (These concepts are also explored on the link of Gitbook I previously sent)

Ah awesome- reading the rewards system now

We're DAO-ifying our community right now and of course this is probably the biggest crux of our issue

Figuring out who brings value, how to measure it, and remove free riders etc.

We have the help channel above this one, but if it's specific to a topic, like reward system, there is a reward system dedicated channel down below. You can also join our Orientation call tomorrow at 6PM CET - 12PM EST, because probably your questions are shared in between other members of the community and it would be fun!

Suggestion: can you find the Gravity channel here? We may be best starting discussion there, and maybe a thread, so as to keep the channel clear for other discussion. You could lay out some of what is happening, in a way you feel comfortable with, and we can make a start there.

Thanks for tagging me! Hey @Juankbell @durgadas ! @Luis Otra Vez is the person I mentioned just earlier. They have a dispute situation, quite complex by the look of it, spilling over into Twitter, and I felt that our more experienced team members could discuss the situation with both sides seeking a resolution / negotiation / agreement. And I feel some technical expertise will be needed! Over to you guys, how shall we proceed?

@everyone The New Reward System is gearing up for it's first quantification and **we need more Quantifiers** to participate in processing all of the wonderful praise action happening in the TEC. If you're a new member or even a seasoned contributor I would like to invite you to participate in this crucial role within our Commons. Quantifiers will even receive TEC tokens (post Commons Upgrade) for their valuable work! Time commitment will be **1-2 hours bi-weekly**, however many hands make for light work so we need as many members as possible to join our Quantifier Pool! We're currently building the onboarding process so especially in this moment, this is the opportunity to provide a **simple and very meaningful contribution** to the evolution of the TEC with your participation and feedback! To learn more about the Reward System (and the Quantifier's role) read up on this forum post - [https://forum.tecommons.org/t/outlining-the-rewards-system-process-v2/646](https://forum.tecommons.org/t/outlining-the-rewards-system-process-v2/646) If this interests you feel free to drop into the #deleted-channel channel or DM me for more information!

Outlining the Rewards System Process.. v2!

Rewards System Process The purpose of this system is to create a way to record, reward and analyze fairly the work done by contributors to the TEC, creating a manner of providing decentralized updates of the action happening in the Commons. By this system we can gather realtime acknowledgement of contributions, in a decentralized manner. We hav...

Really appreciate the heads up on this. I know you're extremely busy and I apologize for asking, and this is embarrassing, but I've struggled in the past with file integrity verification, getting myself into the weeds and essentially giving up. Would you either have time for a quick walkthrough or maybe just a link to some resource you think would be useful? Thank you in advance and no worries if not. Just being reminded of the importance of this awareness and capability is critical for my own development.

Certainly possible it's just me, but went through my account and couldn't see anything related that would have caused this. Is TE academy content set for "content made for kids" or something along those lines if I'm misremembering the exact tag?

Hi everyone! @mafer_cordovas kindly invited me to give a presentation last Tuesday. So unless plans change, I'll be in CSTK Community Hall Voice tonight, 5pm UK time, presenting about the PrinterNet Africa Reparations project, hoping to attract some moral support, or even volunteers! Questions, feedback, connections and related projects all welcome!

Hi @Nate0909 if you mean in terms of demand for those skills I think it's safe to say the demand is very high and should continue to grow. Token Engineering is a nascent field and foundational to building in web3. Does that help answer your question?

_20-Dec-21 03:48 AM_:

I support 4.20! Here are the main reasons: **There is no reason for selling ourselves short. No obvious advantage.** A market cap / valuation of the TEC at launch that is way lower than how the market perceives us serves no purpose. How much is the TEC worth then? We don't know. Perhaps we could have / should have conducted some sort of price discovery? But, we didn't. Current no 1 on Tokenlog, Goldilocks' $1 bet for $1 mil to Advance Token Engineering ([https://github.com/CommonsBuild/commons-config-proposals/issues/127)](https://github.com/CommonsBuild/commons-config-proposals/issues/127)), values the TEC to just above $3 million after initial buy in. Based on the current market dynamics and valuations of other projects I think that is definitely too low. The above proposal would place the valuation at around $9 million. Still not a crazy high valuation but more in line with the current market sentiment. Let's not undervalue token engineering! (edited)

Hi all I was wondering if any one had any pointers for who I should talk to for a couple questions I have. I am trying to build a tool to help non technical people with the token design process. So I was wondering what type of tokens/DAOs/NFTs etc seem to need token design help the most and what issues they have and and also if there is an overlap with existing tools such as cadcad and tokenspice.

Hi @Nate0909 if you mean in terms of demand for those skills I think it's safe to say the demand is very high and should continue to grow. Token Engineering is a nascent field and foundational to building in web3. Does that help answer your question?

With the 420 vote, I feel like people are voting for the headline large market cap, to express confidence in TEC, with a big headline splash up front. If this is all still pretty new, would not a more conservative approach be beneficial, at least at first? Is this a big gamble to take in the early days of TEC? Also, why choose only one? Won't different proposals need different approaches, and therefore different params? Or we are still testing, still finding this all out?

Hi @innov8tor3 and thank you for this feedback. You will see a lot of rationale went into the 420 proposal itself (if anything, if I had more time I would have edited it down!) but the change between the first version of this proposal and this last one was influeced by conversations from the Sunday debates. The price change is intended to provide some protection from synchronized manipulation not just to try to to increase profits. I did a poor job of explaining that change well enough. (edited)

@everyone The New Reward System is gearing up for it's first quantification and I am once again humbly asking for **more Quantifiers** to participate in processing all of the wonderful praise action happening in the TEC. If you're a new member or even a seasoned contributor I would like to invite you to participate in this crucial role within our Commons. Quantifiers will even receive TEC tokens (post Commons Upgrade) for their valuable work! Time commitment will be **1-2 hours bi-weekly**, however many hands make for light work so we need as many members as possible to join our Quantifier Pool! We're currently building the onboarding process so especially in this moment, this is the opportunity to provide a **simple and very meaningful contribution** to the evolution of the TEC with your participation and feedback! To learn more about the Reward System (and the Quantifier's role) read up on this forum post - [https://forum.tecommons.org/t/outlining-the-rewards-system-process-v2/646](https://forum.tecommons.org/t/outlining-the-rewards-system-process-v2/646) If this interests you feel free to drop into the "Calling All Quantifiers!" channel or DM me for more information!

I thought everyone presented very well, and asked us to think about the different params and their effect. My concern with whales is they are a bit like burglars. If they want in, they'll come in, because they have the resources to do so. Some whales may look beneficially on the higher price and higher market cap. A local business man bought a high priced local manor, intending to flout local planning rules to make a large profit. When planning get onto the case, he will offer counter measures that fulfil other local planning objectives, at which point it becomes a negotiation. He can do that because he has large resources at his disposal. IDK what will actually happen with 420, it could be completely brilliant. My track record on crystal ball gazing is spectacularly poor, in my case causing distinct economic damage. A quesion from me might be a good indicator of success. (edited)

@everyone The New Reward System is gearing up for it's first quantification and I am once again humbly asking for **more Quantifiers** to participate in processing all of the wonderful praise action happening in the TEC. If you're a new member or even a seasoned contributor I would like to invite you to participate in this crucial role within our Commons. Quantifiers will even receive TEC tokens (post Commons Upgrade) for their valuable work! Time commitment will be **1-2 hours bi-weekly**, however many hands make for light work so we need as many members as possible to join our Quantifier Pool! We're currently building the onboarding process so especially in this moment, this is the opportunity to provide a **simple and very meaningful contribution** to the evolution of the TEC with your participation and feedback! To learn more about the Reward System (and the Quantifier's role) read up on this forum post -

Hi! Many thanks for the invitation. Love the Hatch project. A question! I want to organize my web2 app as a DAO/cooperative. There are several parties/apps willing to help: Aragon, DAOhaus, Squads, Astro. If you have any thoughts or recommendations, it would be great to learn more.

... to explain better. We have a collaborative app for musicians in a closed beta. Rather than organize as an old school coop, we want to leverage (and share) using web3 tech.

[thread]: Let me try to pitch in. First, these are all financial mechanisms natural to cryptos but quite difficult to accomplish in both traditional or FinTech based finance and one assumes this is just the beginning. To the extent they are all "derivatives" on some underlying crypto asset, there is a close parallel to Finance and Fintech. Slowly, they will all go under the hood as the "Fat Protocol" phenomena sets in.

Hey

I'm the founder and House rep of one of the Houses in RomeDAO, the House of Grapes. We have a set of gigabrains in our policy team and I've introduced some of them to this channel. Of course they love it.

It would be awesome to do some work together.

As the protocol is young but has a notable position in the DOTSAMA ecosystem, I'd wager there are many interesting possibilites to explore and I'd love to get some people from here to get to know our policy teams, both from the House of Grapes but also from the larger RomeDAO and it's Houses.

How would I go about making that a reality?

A big topic for myself is governance structures for Houses and for Rome, with an inspiration being Vitaliks text on no-token governance.

we are working on improvements for the reward system now, so praise quantification has stopped since the hatch, and will resume soon - we have a test quant next week if you're interested to join!


after this, you will be able to see your score and you'll receive TEC tokens every 2 weeks. TEC tokens will have both governance and financial value

@MŒûLK @B cryptsky Hello there! We aren't currently not providing consultancy for projects, but we are encouraging people participation on our community as a way to learn and receive meaningful feedback for your projects. I can suggest to post a job offering or paid consultancy on the Job Board channel, below this one. You can also engage with our Working Groups, like parameters and common swarm, and check if someone there is knowledgable on topics related to yours and engage privately with them if you feel like it. And finally, i am sending you an invitation to the Token Engineering discord server, which have also a lot of Token Engineers that may be interested on helping you!

Edu - TEC Steward.

@MŒûLK @B cryptsky Hello there! We aren't currently not providing consultancy for projects, but we are encouraging people participation on our community as a way to learn and receive meaningful feedback for your projects. I can suggest to post a job offering or paid consultancy on the Job Board channel, below this one. You can also engage with our Working Groups, like parameters and common swarm, and check if someone there is knowledgable on topics related to yours and engage privately with them if you feel like it. And finally, i am sending you an invitation to the Token Engineering discord server, which have also a lot of Token Engineers that may be interested on helping you!

B cryptsky

greetings. Its my first rodeo. Im building a DeFi protocol governed by a DAO. Concept has product market fit and the tech will be good too. Just need to figure the token design/ tokenomics out. Anyone here with the knowledge want to jump on board or willing to help me out? i have a model, just not sure if it will work

_08-Jan-22 02:13 PM_:

Problem is I have more than one model depending on the route I take. I want to do a fair distribution via platform rewards but that means less initial capital to make the project successful. I‚Äôm assuming fundraising means higher market cap on TGE and less organic growth. Also I‚Äôm not sure in either scenario if my APR models for token distribution will constitute to a failure of the economic system when taking into account token price scenarios. With or without fundraising I‚Äôm not even sure what amounts I should initialize the liquidity pool with and how much of a buffer for market making is required to manage the validity of the model. I just feel that through the sessions I will be going further down the rabbit hole without building an optimal model. Without the support/services of someone with experience I feel ill just be trying to wing it, which isn‚Äôt fair on the community I‚Äôm trying to build via this project. I‚Äôm willing to pay for such services but would prefer an mix of partnership and paid service.

So it‚Äôs more of asking questions and getting some guidance rather than direct support?

_09-Jan-22 12:38 AM_:

One suggestion is to have an outline description of what you want to do that you can share. Same for you @MŒûLK . I'm quite open to this, others might view it as shilling. But any support / service organisation needs to understand what it is supporting, and that must be true here.

These Params and others, and their effects, are discussed, I believe, by the Params working group. For both yourself and @MŒûLK , I find that listening is a key first step, and then you will need to present your idea or proposition, possibly as a community proposal which then gets voted on. @Edu - TEC Steward. has given some sound first steps!

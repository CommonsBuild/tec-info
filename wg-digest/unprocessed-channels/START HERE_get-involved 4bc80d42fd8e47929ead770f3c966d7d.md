gm guys - Ive watched the orientation videos and done some lurking but I am new here. Im stopping by today because I was approched by the team from [https://monstershelter.io/](https://monstershelter.io/) about helping them with the tokenomics design around their game but I dont personally have the time necessary to devote to helping them. Im not sure what would come next - in orientation it said project teams form organically - is there anyone here who'd be interested in helping out with this or getting involved somehow?

Hello there! If it's a job, you could share it on the Job Board channel, with the information required and how to apply to it. The other suggestion would be to engage with the working groups like Labs and connect with people who has knowledge there and could provide you support.

!praise @mafer_cordovas for their super supportive attitude, and their alertness in Twitter to possibilities for CS and TEC, I hope to build on that immediately

Something to note, perhaps, in CS and TEC, and if I can help with these runway landing lights at all, I'd love to do so. @mafer_cordovas noted a related conversation in Twitter, and this is the next step to that conversation ...

It strikes me repeatedly there is a typical runway DAOs need to build landing lights around for visitors, namely ... Proposals, Projects, Products and Services. Many DAOs are involved in these, but I don't see the landing lights clearly enough in every DAO yet. 1/?

Hi all, fun chatting on the orientation call this morning! I recently setup a SourceCred instance as part of our pre-launch contribution tracking mechanisms to incentivize building an open-source DAO governed data marketplace (a fork of Ocean Market). I'm also playing around with cadCAD and augmented bonding curve simulations while exploring the effects of different hatch parameters. I'm interested in learning more about conviction voting. So, I guess with all that, the TEC community feels like the right place to be

Hi there, I'm Justina, I'm new here, but super excited to get involved and contribute.

Got super facinated by James S. Fishkin ideas, wanted to continue to do something with it, but sadly it got abandoned and I end up pivoting towards "real world" jobs/startups and got some experience there. - Fast forward few years, I discovered Crypto/Web 3 and DAO's and realized that my fast knowledge about governance systems, voting and fair decision making could be adapted in DAO context and expanded upon. - At the moment I'm part of a web 3 design studio where I'm working as user researcher and design sprint facilitator. We have some community governance in place but is very far from being decentralized enough and be called DAO. -I have super strong curiosity to learn more about tokenomics, TE and incentive design, I hope I can find my place in this community and grow my knowledge with other curious folks

Hello everyone! My name is Francisco, I am very happy to be here, this is my first experience with Daos, so I discover a lot of new information every day. It's a bit difficult but collaborating to change the world can't be easy, right? I studied communication, at first I dedicated myself to editing videos and animations. I also like to write and research about communication, politics and technology. I currently work as a project manager and product owner. I would like to dedicate my time to projects that are closer to my philosophy of life. That's why I'm here. I have a lot of energy to share and collaborate in this collective construction. It excites me to think about it. I hope I can help with something.

Hello, My name is Will Holley ‚Äì¬†I lead an independent RadicalxChange chapter that is developing token standards for Partial Common Ownership ([https://partialcommonownership.com)](https://partialcommonownership.com)/) and am the founder of 721 Labs. Looking forward to meeting other builders. Cheers!

Partial Common Ownership Tokens (PCOT)

Partial Common Ownership (PCO) is a new system of property ownership inspired by the ideas in Radical Markets. It is both ethically fairer and economically more efficient than the systems of property espoused by capitalism (private-ownership) and communism (public-ownership).

These things aren‚Äôt criticism. They are really just suggestions to fill needs that might not be met. 1. More analysis.. of everything. Individual functions, past decisions, the system as a whole, more perspective of how it can be utilized. Even if it takes slowing down progress and duration of voting before proposals are accepted. 2. A new working group for future-proofing. They could be tasked with very specific well audited goals like finding loopholes, exploits, anything that can be used to hold the entire project at ransom. (They would obviously need to be very diligent about communicating their work, and have a great understanding of features and public goods.

_14-Jul-21 06:32 AM_:

The slowing down of the proposals/voting process is something that may behoove us in the future given our past voting experiences. The big votes we've had are complex and nuanced and do require a depth of understanding that takes time in order to make informed decisions. And I just like the idea of dedication to future proofing as a working group.. or as a swat team.

I went to my first community hall and it felt pretty broad / open-ended. Wondering if it would be useful to have another call added or a rotating of calls that focus very much on new members. I also have ideas of how to do that if people are interested in iterating on it.

Just sharing a bit of feedback re: praise notifications. At first, it was really helpful/fun to receive a private message notifying me whenever I got praised. But now that I know where the channel is and it lights up whenever I'm praised (tagged), I find myself doing a "yeah, I get it" whenever I get a new praise dm and have to go look at my private messages *and* the channel it in order to get the notifications to go away. I still get a little thrill with the private message, but it's being overtaken slowly by the frustration. Hope that's helpful, not an urgent issue for me by any means.

_17-Dec-21 10:43 AM_:

Yes, @MS and I were just talking about this yesterday and he's working on a framework that will be useful for handling this question of roles. More on this next week, no doubt. FWIW, I think there is still going to be plenty of situations where a survey is going to be the right call for gathering feedback. But I'm also really excited about the emoji route for allowing folks to self-select.

_17-Dec-21 06:16 PM_:

Absolutely agree with everyone @Gideonro @Tam2140 @nic @Vyvy-vi @Edu - TEC Steward. and I think the brainstorming conversations will help out a lot. The model we were thinking of will utilize the template we were checking out on Miro @Tam2140 - the idea is to have the phases/milestones and then the TEC perspective, Member perspective, Deliverables/Artifacts, and then Action items. I think the action items will be important because it will help us consider the different things we want to tackle next, to make sure we keep an eye on the process as something that is always improving.

I currently update the weekly Events for this server which are based on the community calendar. As such, I am recommending the use of a bot for this task such as Apollo or Sesh. This would drastically remove repetitive work. Events, if recurring, could be created one time. Using this bot will require the creation of a new events channel where events will be listed instead of using the built-in Events feature of Discord. As always, pros/cons exist. Not my decision here so just throwing this out there. Attached is a screenshot for an event created by the bot. Thanks for reading.

Apollo is free to create recurring meetings, Sesh requires a premium subscription. Not trying to push one or the other, just suggestions. This is my last week updating the Events so whatever the decision will not be beneficial to myself personally. (edited)

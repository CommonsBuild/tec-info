Did you have a look at the apostrophe issue? (

[https://github.com/CommonsBuild/coordination/issues/563)](https://github.com/CommonsBuild/coordination/issues/563))

I checked in with dpy contributors and it looks like there is no such issue in dpy(might depend on how params are taken in)

I was thinking it might be fun to create a complex systems & cognitive science paper reading group within TE, and I was wondering if anyone might be interested? The focus would be how we can apply principles from complex adaptive systems and AI research to social systems. I'd like it to be more fun and to be a place to share excitements and visions for the future, using our reading as the source of inspiration. DM me if you're interested or have ideas!

I was wondering about the recent vote where there were many signalling proposals(of sorts). Would it be feasible (not sure if something that should be built into TokenLog, since that tools used by other people too), to perhaps have another issue label for issues that are not directly participating in the vote, and display them with a Signal text or something, but not let anyone spend VP to vote on those for the actual vote? (*also not sure if this might actually lead to some confusion, but just thinking about it)

Idea: Weekly or monthly community events that promote cooperation and learning but are super fun and dynamic. (Is this already a thing? Im new) EVENT HOST Designs a game where the community has to use certain functions of the commons or already existing tec public goods or creation tools to achieve a common goal. I know thats oddly vague.. Maybe they have to use the governance system to control all functions on their spacecraft, but critical systems are damaged and they have have limited fuel. (Tokens) Each person starts with the same amount of tokens. They have to use proposals to fully repair systems once the repairs are done, and that requires a certain amount of fuel. The catch is there are multiple baddies that are invited to a seperate group chat right before the game and collaborate to control 51% of the fuel that is either still among crew or tied up in tokens to repair systems. They can trade. The ship computer will self destruct if anyone is holding 51%. I hopefully a well thought out idea though.. I didnt put aby thought into that. It probably can be designed much much better than what I just wrote. but there are a lot of social games out there that could be represented using a token system and dont even require creating software or programming. Everything can be executed verbally. This particular one is a great way to interact and solve abstract challenges together using a familiar system, and a lesson involving the incredibly scary and real threat of social engineering that has already destroyed some good projects. You could probably do a lot of stuff.. im not even creative.. theres a lot of potential for someone that is creative and has experience hosting community events. (I bet they would get insane amounts of praise if they did a good event too.)

On StarkNet, L1 and L2 smart contracts can interact directly with each other via messages and finality is in the range of a few minutes (unlike Optimismn with 1 week). StarkNet will allow very cheap on-chain voting but also off-chain voting with on-chain execution. Really something to pay attention to for DAOs.

Hi everybody. The seperation of governance rights from a crypto token is a challenge faced by numerous daos.

Idea - can we set up a 'where and when' chat channel, so that people can 1. share when they're going to be uncontactable or away from the TEC for a while (they're on holiday or they have a period where they need to focus on other things), and 2. if they're going to be visiting somewhere, they can share where and when and that might facilitate people meeting up in real life

Hey @anna-marie! Nice to meet you! We just recently started using an online tool (

**sobol.io**

) for the purposes of tracking roles/responsibilities, and creating organizational maps. (

*I still have to reach out to you about this too!*

![https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f605.png](https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f605.png)

) I asked for the contributors' country and city where their mainly based in to pin them in a world map. Please see attached pic

[Thanks for bringing this up, @Vyvy-vi!  Hey @anna-marie! Nice to meet you! We just recently started using an online tool (**sobol.io**) for the purposes of tracking roles/responsibilities, and creating organizational maps.

Sounds brilliant! And please do reach out if I can be useful with this. I'm going to be away from 8th - 22nd Sept, but let's chat after that? And yes... I was just thinking a simple 'where and when' channel as an addition to the chat channels, so people can say 'hey, I think I'm going to be in Barcelona for all of October. Anyone around?' or sharing holiday plans so we all know who's not available. Just a simple, easy, chatty channel.

_01-Dec-21 07:43 AM_:

Idea - a recurring one! If folk identify which people they are connected to, and which DAOs they belong to, it becomes possible to build a network map. It strikes me Discord have the raw materials for this already. But in terms of navigating the DAOscape, a mapping tool to get from one place to another can help DAO citizens move around with more speed and certainty. We would need DAOs to identify their sector(s). For example, climate action would be very popular, I would think. Where a DAO is more complex, a well connected person might be willing to explain and direct folk who are new arrivals in particular places. Would love to talk to anyone who knows where this is already happening, or has the technical skills to build on existing Discord data. Many thanks!

Hi TE Community. I wanted to share some of our latest work on TrueBlocks. We put this together permissionlessly (that is, unrelated to GitCoin): [https://www.tokenomics.io/gitcoin/](https://www.tokenomics.io/gitcoin/). It's an attempt to try to see how deeply we can see into a smart-contract related ecosystem without asking permission of anyone including the core devs of that ecosystem. We're very interested in this type of "from the outside" oversight of communities (or maybe better called "community-driven oversight"). I'd be interested in anyone's feedback if anyone has any. Cheers.

[Hi TE Community. I wanted to share some of our latest work on TrueBlocks. We put this together permissionlessly (that is, unrelated to GitCoin):](about:blank#)

[https://www.tokenomics.io/gitcoin/](https://www.tokenomics.io/gitcoin/)

. It's an attempt to try to see how deeply we can see into a smart-contract related ecosystem without asking permission of anyone including the core devs of that ecosystem. We're very interested in this type of "from the outside" oversight of communities (or maybe better called "community-driven oversight"). I'd be interested in anyone's feedback if anyone has any. Cheers.

I think I have developed a good sense of it (we can have a nice talk about that). A collaboration for implementing ABC to Greens for Good can benefit everyone, it would be a great validation and learning experience. I am also thinking that we can put this experiment on Gitcoin as a grant before the 9th or Mar. and pledge to publish the results (report) of our findings. Where can we start?

Hey all, I am messaging on behalf of a trust that I am quite close to. The trust is trying to decide what to do with a beautiful piece of land in the hills of Kwazulu-Natal, South Africa. The land has been a school for the last 100 years, and has a revered legacy in the community where it exists. It has always extended itself beyond a school, and quite literally provided a home for so many of its pupils. While it has never been a for-profit organisation, it has recently shut down due to a lack of funding. It is inactive currently and there are some interested parties however, the trust specifies that if the ownership of the land is shifted, it must go towards a group working for social good through education. I am leaving this message here and if anyone has any ideas or have seen any cases of strong models for an eco school of land stewards, or alternatively, if there is an existing, relevant organisation that would be interested in extending its work to a location in South Africa. Hope everyone is good!

_16-Mar-22 07:50 AM_:

First of all, so sorry for the late reply! Secondly, thanks for considering us for this partnership! I perceive that your intention is to try to use our tooling, like the ABC, on Greens for Good. Would you like to explain in which state Green for Good find itself at (is it a DAO? How many people, etc)? I wanna add too, that all our tooling is open source, so they are free to use, but also, we built this tooling most of the times in the context of a Cultural Build, that frames them. This reply comes a week off, from the deadline you provided, but if you are still up for the idea, I would suggest you can share a roadmap with a potential list of needs and expections on how the TEC could partner with you guys!

I am working on a legal operating system for metaverses. The idea is to develop a base legal layer to make metaverses with economic, business, commercial, and social activity functional. The goal is to have as much automation as possible so that people can spend more time doing things other than, say, human-led arbitration. This is not very different from how legal frameworks make cities and countries functional and usable. I am actively looking for lawyers and relevant coders to flesh out ideas a bit more. I can send more details if you are interested. Please let me know

_28-Mar-22 05:04 AM_:

Hi folks - I am an commercial/IP/patent attorney and the founder of [https://crowdfundedcures.org](https://crowdfundedcures.org/). Our mission is to leverage token engineering (IP-NFTs from Molecule.to's platform x pay-for-success smart contracts) backed by healthcare payers to create a business model for open source drug development by repurposing generic drugs and nutraceuticals. This can reduce costs of drug development by 100x and accelerate it by 10x. I am also advising a few web3 projects including VitaDAO, Kuva.com and amon.tech. We have partnered with VitaDAO and Open Source Pharma Foundation and are commissioning a feasibility study with several generic drug use cases for a pilot (e.g. proposed rapamycin + exercise Phase 2 RCT [https://www.lifespan.io/news/brad-stanfield-rapamycin-trial/)](https://www.lifespan.io/news/brad-stanfield-rapamycin-trial/)) . More info here ([https://vitadao.medium.com/a-new-financial-model-for-repurposing-off-patent-longevity-medicines-4483bdfc6773)](https://vitadao.medium.com/a-new-financial-model-for-repurposing-off-patent-longevity-medicines-4483bdfc6773)) and please see attached figure. Drug development is suffering from diminishing returns under Eroom's law and we think that token engineering could be used to help solve this trillion dollar problem. A simple way to describe the idea is a "bounty" system (pay for success contract) to fund large clinical trials for off-patent/unmonopolisable therapies. This allows an open source approach in drug development without reliance on patents, and would unlock the network effects/synergies that the open source movement brings to software and apply it to drug development, which is probably the most expensive and specialised engineering problem that society faces, but where the pharma industry totally relies on enforceable patents/regulatory exclusivity to get a new product to market. Publicly funded drug development is available but centralised and inefficient (typically the pharma industry funds Phase 3 RCTs at the "last mile" and reaps the multi-billion dollar rewards. With PFS arbitrage, the "reward" can be 100x smaller due to lower costs of repurposing generic drugs and nutraceuticals. (edited)

[First of all, so sorry for the late reply! Secondly, thanks for considering us for this partnership! I perceive that your intention is to try to use our tooling, like the ABC, on Greens for Good. Would you like to explain in which state Green for Good find itself at (is it a DAO? How many people, etc)? I wanna add too, that all our tooling is open source, so they are free to use, but also, we built this tooling most of the times in the context of a Cultural Build, that frames them. This reply comes a week off, from the deadline you provided, but if you are still up for the idea, I would suggest you can share a roadmap with a potential list of needs and expections on how the TEC could partner with you guys!

_03-Apr-22 01:58 AM_:

Thanks for your reply. Never too late :) I do believe that a collaboration would be neneficial to both networks. Here we have two networks that I see as commentary and perhaps with different cultures. So the best thing is to be able to have a discussion and assess the potential and the need. I guess I am looking for a facilitator, someone I can spend some time with to do some translation, before we can write needs and requirements. But most importantly is to surface the mutual benefits, so that people from both networks can be incentivized to pay attention. Who can I speak to? I also want to mention that I took some tasks with the Commons Stack to get acquainted with your culture. (edited)

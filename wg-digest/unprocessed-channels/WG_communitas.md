It seems like a good idea, 3 x 3-4min videos, but I would think @Suga has a unique perspective for what content to present and how having served as the onboarding coordinator for the past number of months. Can you help me understand whether this initiative to make onboarding videos is being driven by @Suga or by Comms? @Suga was in the process of doing it, right?

_14-Sep-21 04:14 PM_:

We are joining efforts.

So we are going to use Suga's videos as a main reference and try to have it done a bit more proffesional and with the aesthetics of the rest of the videos, if possible

In this case, I think, our priority was to have a video that when people joined, they can get a grasp of how discord works and a bit of our cultural build, so they aren't so lost

and it gets sent automatically with the bot

Talking with @Suga there seems to be some lack of communication around this particular initiative. Might we agree that since someone was already working on it, it would be preferable if you and/or @chuygarcia.eth first sync with them that there is a desire to go in a different direction? The open issue is one place to do that (

liviade

would it be possible to link it to a spreadsheet tho? I think it would make it easier to visualize and scroll and make notes if needed

Based on the index coop articles linked above, here are some ideas I have: <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f449.png" width=20 height=20>

**Add more questions to orientation data collection bot:** <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f539.png" width=20 height=20>

What are your interests? <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f539.png" width=20 height=20>

What are skills you have that you enjoy using? <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f539.png" width=20 height=20>

What interested you in joining? <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f539.png" width=20 height=20>

Which timezone are you in? <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f539.png" width=20 height=20>

How much time are you interested in contributing, if you want to contribute?

*This way we know exactly how to direct EVERY new user right away, specific to their needs vs generalised answers.* <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f449.png" width=20 height=20>

**Prepare slide deck for orientation call. Give complete information for those who want to contribute right away:** <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f539.png" width=20 height=20>

What is the trusted seed? Join the trusted seed. <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f539.png" width=20 height=20>

Working group summaries including: - description of focus -wishlist -how can I be a part of that working group? include info such as: --- article/video tutorial for specific tools used by this wg --- when are meetings usually held? --- who is the steward/ person to reach out to? --- tasks categorised by time availability (0-5hrs, 6-9 hrs, 10-14 hrs, 15+ hours) <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f539.png" width=20 height=20>

Link to gitbook <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f539.png" width=20 height=20>

Discord tutorial <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f539.png" width=20 height=20>

Zenhub tutorial <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f539.png" width=20 height=20>

Link to zenhub <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f539.png" width=20 height=20>

When is the next community call? Where can the recording be found if the time doesn't work for them?

*This way they won't have to click multiple links in the middle of the orientation call. All information needed is presented on the screen, maintaining focus and ease for users new to discord. They will also know what to expect to know by the time the orientation call is finished and question time can be for more in depth questions/questions not answered by slide deck.* <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f449.png" width=20 height=20>

**Make bot tell users to join orientation call (including when and where) AND share the slide deck beforehand**

*This way, if they miss the call or can't make it, they have the slide deck as a source of info and can get started on taking action/contributing right away.*

I‚Äôll be missing the meeting tomorrow morning due to personal reasons <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f613.png" width=20 height=20>

but update from my end: - I‚Äôve added comments to some zenhub issues relating to onboarding bot and onboarding video. - Still working on figuring out how to communicate the entirety of the dashboard idea clearly so that I can make a forum post and zenhub issue for it (@chuygarcia and @Mount Manu have been helping give advice for now, and as soon as posted we can get feedback from everyone <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f973.png" width=20 height=20>

) -I posted ideas on soft gov channel about possible way to do the next soft gov meeting so that we can use it for user research on the dashboard idea, as well as any other communitas projects in the future. This way we get input from our members right away on how they perceive the user types of the TEC, where they encounter frustrations when interacting with the TEC and what causes these frustrations/problems. Working with @Mount Manu on this as well. I hope the things mentioned above have been helpful in pushing our goals forward as a WG! <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f60a.png" width=20 height=20>

I will catch up by watching the YouTube video for this meeting!

Also, didn't quite catch what we are praising Gene for?

. Finally, we mentioned Commons Upgrade twice, it seemed significant, but it didn't make it onto the funding plan. Do we want that? (edited)

Hey folks. I have some good and bad news (well, good for me!) - I've just started an amazing second paid role this week for Popcorn but it means that I won't have a lot of time to give here. I'll pop on from time to time, and stay in touch, and I'm always happy to do small tasks from time-to-time. If things change and I have more time, I'll let you know.

Already asked Peth about MyMeta Profiles because it is interesting for 0mega, also think Gravity, i.e. ppl learning & sharing here some serious skills to decorate their profiles

@natesuits we can be on the Spotlight at TEC call

or do we want to share different space for learning about other value aligned communities

Thanks @David D. - TEC ! I had a look and made some comments and - apologies that I'm jumping in here late but - I would like to ask whether this is the right moment to do an onboarding rush!? It might be best if we hold of for another Sprint or two. How about a tweet thread about the **TEC's Mission, Vision and Values!?** That might better serve to attract those that are already value aligned, promote the TEC's mission... and also give us a little more time to smooth out the orientation before we do a rush to attract a wave of new joiners.

Did TEC experience have a hand in that?

I've had a think about where this question needs to go, and I'll try here. Saw a great presentation on reward systems several days ago, with TEC involved, and just wondering whether folks feel Reward Systems are important to community, and maybe therefore something Communitas would want to engage with? Obviously, rewards can be intrinsic as well as extrinsic, different people have different motivations, but that seems to me to be an essence of how communities are motivated. Thoughts, folks? If the wrong place, I'm happy to be redirected, just I'm really interested in this. @Suga ?

_02-Oct-21 04:06 AM_:

Thanks. I'm always thinking how any group or subgroup relates to one another, is Communitas more inward looking for the moment? In the long run, I think community incentives and management is something every DAO needs, and would be great for TEC to show its skills in that arena. For me, reward schemes are the flip side of the Governance discussion, one is all about incentives and the other about effective management of resource ... However I'm still learning, so don't have the full picture here, I recognise that for sure.

Unless my case is an anomaly, I can confirm that the "new member" role is not automatically removed after 2 weeks. I've been on the TEC server for probably close to 2 months and still have that.

I would love to know whether onboarding is seen as part of orientation, because I see the two as closely related, a meet and greet function, plus direction for new arrivals, with the Working Groups (WG) having a central function ... It's also, IMO, another key DAO function, but one I see other DAOs not doing so well at. Would be amazing to aim for developing a metrics system other DAOs could use, and where TEC could provide some expertise.

I don't have a model as such, but I do think folk need to be greeted on arrival, and then directed ideally using minimal resource, to make it not so intensive on stewards, but with an offer of support as needed.

In my experience, human connection has been the most powerful way to bring and keep people in your space and it's also really high-effort. I think having a balance between a set of really well curated resources/tools for self-onboarding -- combined with a well-trained team of experienced community members with excellent interpersonal/EI skills who's role is to make 1:1 onboarding support connections.



tbh, I still have no idea what praise is other than inferring that it's similar to the "props" we give in the SC discord. My biggest foot-hold personally is that there's obviously some work I can connect with here (communitas and rewards-systems)

@Tam2140

Yeah, there's totally a "first round" of onboarding followed by a "second round" of more specific onboarding into your area of interest/labor.

I've always really wanted to design an onboarding "skill tree" full of quests and badges like in a video game.

I like that @LBS - the metaphor is useful and the framework maps well to the way I see this stuff too. For those who are interested, here's a link to the engagement pyramid framework I mentioned in the call. I used to use it w/ my old org, focusing on social change work. It was written before DAOs existed, but I think there are areas of crossover: [https://commonslibrary.org/engagement-pyramid/](https://commonslibrary.org/engagement-pyramid/)

In my experience, human connection has been the most powerful way to bring and keep people in your space and it's also really high-effort. I think having a balance between a set of really well curated resources/tools for self-onboarding -- combined with a well-trained team of experienced community members with excellent interpersonal/EI skills who's role is to make 1:1 onboarding support connections.

_05-Oct-21 02:37 AM_:

Typically skilled educators agree. This is a typical learning process, how do we join a community, where do we fit in, how can we make a contribution ... It's a shame schools don't focus on this! I wrote this about a sister community ... 'I want to do more, there's a heck of a lot needs doing. I like X, lots of energy, but they don't seem to be picking folk like me up, we stay buried in the weeds. I call the process of Onboarding, Orientation and Contribution the maximising of community, and overall could call this "no folk left behind" ...'

Wonderful idea! Would make the process fun, and needs tailoring to every DAO. Could be adapted, since certain tasks repeat across DAOs, like design, build, story telling and so on.

I love all the links above. Please keep sharing! Also what are your thoughts on getting groups of people focused on specific areas of the dashboard. For example a group of people could start collecting research relating to onboarding, and doing member interviews so that the onboarding mentioned in the zenhub issue may be improved? New members can start being interviewed, much like what happened in the last communitas call, in order to hear what their experience has been like so far and discover pain points where we have opportunity to improve.

I am planning to start reaching out to stewards to do 1-1 to start hearing their thoughts and learning more about their needs, and initial feedback on the dashboard. But it would be so awesome if others can help in other areas of the dashboard so we can build together

Praise bot messages was a bit confusing. You have to know the relationship between CS and TEC for it to make sense. Once TEC tokens become more freely available and TEC increasingly stands on its own legs in the world, we will no longer be able to assume that kind of knowledge for new community members.

Thinking about this a bit more, I think it's probably worth giving the Discord server a basic review from this same eye of a newcomer. For instance, it seems worth having an "about TEC" channel with just a restricted (i.e. small) number of posts that provide a quick overview of TEC (history, mission, values, fun trivia etc..) without having to have a guest who's just exploring have to hop off to a bunch of websites. This channel should also be accessible even before one accepts the terms of the community, right? Note that there are a few links like this already in the "orientation" channel but they're buried in all the messages and though they're pinned, Discord isn't great at driving people to pinned posts. So, they're pretty much buried. I'm happy to help or drive a newcomer server language/icon/navigation assessment if folks think it's useful. The product would just be a Google doc or something outlining (probably prioritized) recommendations.

Like a Google docs would be a nice starting point, if you share it here we can build on top of it

Cool. I'll take an initial crack at it sometime tomorrow and share the link here so others can add to it.

Hi @Gideonro and thank you for sharing this perspective. It is something that we are in the process of addressing. There is a piece of technical work required and this small project is underway. You can track the progress in the github issue #906.

Thinking about this a bit more, I think it's probably worth giving the Discord server a basic review from this same eye of a newcomer. For instance, it seems worth having an "about TEC" channel with just a restricted (i.e. small) number of posts that provide a quick overview of TEC (history, mission, values, fun trivia etc..) without having to have a guest who's just exploring have to hop off to a bunch of websites. This channel should also be accessible even before one accepts the terms of the community, right? Note that there are a few links like this already in the "orientation" channel but they're buried in all the messages and though they're pinned, Discord isn't great at driving people to pinned posts. So, they're pretty much buried. I'm happy to help or drive a newcomer server language/icon/navigation assessment if folks think it's useful. The product would just be a Google doc or something outlining (probably prioritized) recommendations.

_09-Oct-21 05:17 AM_:

Your fresh eyes here are very welcome. In Monday's Communitas call, @Vyvy-vi will present changes we hope to deploy as part of a new discord onboarding journey. I belive that #join-here is already a channel that is viewable before accepting the T&C of the server. So adding to that channel or creating a new #about-TEC are two possibilites for the kind of collection of useful newcomer-specific posts to live. Looking forward to seeing you all on Monday!

I think the current message doesn't include the commons stack icon, it's just that the discord bot application sending this message is a bot that's common between the TEC and CommonsStack. We talked about splitting the 2 bots up - [https://github.com/CommonsBuild/coordination/issues/906](https://github.com/CommonsBuild/coordination/issues/906) However, since the rewards-system praise re-design is going on, we could potentially hold off, since we are planning on having an MVP by next month

@Tam2140 and @Edu - TEC Steward. - thanks for the pointers. That provides very helpful context. It's great to see, too, that there is a solution to the Praise bot issue already underway. And I agree, @Vyvy-vi, that if the MVP is on the way by next month, it's best to just keep focused there.

So sorry for today's mess @Gideonro @LBS @MS. We will try to do a workshop to finish the points on the Onboarding journey, it will be probably fit to match @Vyvy-vi timing, are you guys up for that? Maybe also @ALOYSIOUS (edited)

Thank you for thinking of me, please keep me in the loop as timing shakes out. I have a busy schedule which is making me very happy and will attend all the things I'm passionate about in the times that I have available... this is a group I'm passionate about. That and I think @Vyvy-vi is really cool. <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f60e.png" width=20 height=20>

I've learned something new almost every single time I've been in their presence digitally which is so rad. P.s. apologies for dipping out early I didn't get a chance to check in I was going to say something that might be distracting for me was having to leave a little ways into the call to prepare for the meta-eth researchers and the legitimacy forum we held in the sourcecred server.

Hey everyone! Here is an initial consolidation of thought into a diagram for the onboarding points that came up on the call today. Shout out to @Gideonro for the help! There are a couple iterations that lead to this and I am happy to show that progression on a call next time we meet if meaningful. I am confident this will need even more refactor and hope it helps spur some thoughts or ideas consistent with our call today <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f64f.png" width=20 height=20>

And here's the revised Discord Server audit doc, based on our call today: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/17ArOa1BikAk20Czf1vbmZjT_ll0OQSc9rUrdFm9SAGc/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17ArOa1BikAk20Czf1vbmZjT_ll0OQSc9rUrdFm9SAGc/edit?usp=sharing) I also went ahead and made changes on @Vyvy-vi's demo server. I'm sure there are still things we'll need to move around but at least this will get us to the next steps. Also, I'm really digging the process flow that @MS has pulled together and I can see how this guide will definitely connect w/ the new layout. Also, tks for the great call today, @Edu - TEC Steward. - you do a nice job of balancing inclusivity and productivity (i.e. relationships and tasks).

@Gideonro @MS I've added you to the role "Orientation Coordinators" so that you can see @orientation-data from the survey. It is being temporarily dropped in that channel while @Vyvy-vi updates the bot to drop it in a notion or airtable or google sheet (whichever is the easier options from a coding POV).

Thanks, @Tam2140. I'm still trying to understand the connection between zenhub and github. Do we have any write-up for this for newcomers? (I could take a whack at it, if not - once I figure it out).

_17-Oct-21 04:34 AM_:

Hi Gideon. Thanks for asking. It's quite simple. Zenhub is a tool that provides a view into github repositories. This view facilitates using github for project management as opposed to the original use of github which had been development, so managing codebase. All the issues continue to exits in a github respository but to view that respository on the Sprint board and using the concept of "epics", which is just issues grouped together under a common theme, we use Zenhub. Hope this helps.

Thanks, @Tam2140. I see. That makes sense. At some point it might be worth looking at some sort of doc that lays out what kind of coordination happens where and with what tools - if that doesn't already exist. That's a later priority though. I'm just thinking about the areas that don't immediately make sense to me as a newcomer. I might just start jotting down notes as I go so I don't forget what the oboarding was like as I was going through it.

Heads up, I was going through the server clone joining process and writing down experiences/thoughts and the verification failed. Not sure if this is because there's a bug or because I was taking a long time writing things down before I clicked the green "Click here to verify!" button. When I clicked it I quickly got a red "this interaction failed" message. Figured I'd let you know just in case it wasn't user error and this information is useful.

Quick question @MS , the last page is the one dedicated to Survey? If it is, shall we add a 4th option for More information about how to contribute? I really liked the new diagrams and the concepts of the adult plant, that's a nice concept to explore, i imagined it even something like, seeds, roots and tree (edited)

It's a direct relation to the flow on page 2 <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f44d.png" width=20 height=20>

- 'Looking for information' step. That's a cool idea! I'm hoping to discuss and work through ideas like this tomorrow so we can submit a good final recommendation for onboarding MVP <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f642.png" width=20 height=20>

- Pg 3: Is for the actual questions etc of the discord bot. - Pg 4: Is the first step in the flow (agree to terms) - Pg 5: Is where we can include and finalize the survey questions. - Pg6: Is where we can include content for the more information step of the onboarding. I figured the first 5-10mins of the meeting tomorrow I could frame the thought of the document to dive into the brainstorming?

_20-Oct-21 05:55 PM_:
No rules. We try to keep to a similar template for some WG docs (agenda, manifesto, namely) but there are no set rules for typography in our working docs. I appreciate the additions you've made here. They bring better clarity. These flows are great, @MS, and will help focus our discussions in tomorrow's working session.

Thinking of scale, could we change the website so that enough of the information commonly shared or communicated in an orientation call can be found and read prior to people joining a discord (excluding onboarding people on how to use tools used by specific WGs) ? <-in a way that is much shorter than the link dump that we do on newcomers and shorter than the gitbook.Then we can ask members to share our website instead of our discord to ensure that this info is available prior to joining the discord. We can even show off all the great things we're doing here, like member testimonials of what its like to be a part of this community, the services we offer (gravity training, comms marketing, omega TE library, funding, tools and guidance for regenerative TE projects). We can also share on a high level the ways they can contribute. If we do this, it opens up time spent in orientation calls where people can instead ask questions and we can frame the answers based on the info they include in the question...it can even become a meeting where people verbally share what they love doing and what they're interested in and get WITHIN that call recommendations or next steps. Orientation calls becomes even more personal (asking for input from newcomers via a self intro). Also makes it more attractive to join if the website gives them this info <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f604.png" width=20 height=20>

TEC Onboarding Flow Visual

Context Hey hey! Today I had a vision of the TEC onboarding flow MVP come to me and decided to whip it up in a Miro board. It details a fairly simple front-end flow for newcomers, as well as a back-end flow for Guides (aka welcomers/buddies/Eduardo) to track first-interaction. This flow make...

This is super awesome @LBS - it's a great refactor to the v2 diagram - I've updated our doc.


I've added as v3 to keep the history, but this evolution you recommended is way better and more simplified.

Interesting, I have a points... About the backend - In future, we might be moving away from #üìàÔΩúonboarding-data, and all of this might be going to a Notion Kanban Board, where we can track these things. About the in-channel-survey - I'm not sure how we can feasibly do that(due to how we need actual messages, which means if we have a channel for it, old survey data messages would lie around in that channel), maybe we can do this by making private threads, or something?

ÔΩúorientation-data, and all of this might be going to a Notion Kanban Board, where we can track these things." Makes sense, though unless that change is going to happen really soon I don't think there's any harm in creating a flow like the one I've suggested for the MVP. It requires no changes other than bringing more people in to help newcomers, which we wanted to do anyway. Then, in progressively better iterations of the onboarding experience, we can create better methods/SOP of tracking engagement for Guides.

Yeah this is where I made the biggest assumptions and have the least experience. My ideal version would be a #your-guide channel that is unique to every person instead of being like a normal channel where everyone can see everyone's messages. Not sure that's really possible. Then you'd fill out the survey and get a few messages in that channel giving resources and explaining how to get more resources from the bot with commands. You could always come back and use the commands to get different resources or repeat resources. Maybe that's only possible in a direct message bot, which honestly wouldn't be the worst, it can just be a bit confusing to simultaneously get a message *and* jump into a new server when you're new to Discord. That could be improved by having the bot send a direct message after agreeing to the rules or after verification so it's not all happening at once. Then the bot could give initial resources based on your in-message survey and additional resources based on bot commands. I think it'd be good to give the bot a name like "Your TEC Guide" and have that instead of a #your-guide channel. Maybe the verification channel could even give you a little prompt to look at your direct messages for more information after verification.

_25-Oct-21 01:54 PM_:

Yeah, I think it may be too much or not possible to make the bot do it all in the channel the way I envisioned. But I think it could do it in the DMs. My one beef with the DMs is that it can be pretty disorienting for people who are easily distracted or new to Discord. If that's an audience we want to care for, then it could help to delay the message a little. If we don't mind letting those folks struggle a little/aren't specifically trying to guide those kinds of people into our space and don't mind if they potentially float away; then it would act as a selective accessibility tool.

_25-Oct-21 02:06 PM_:

Currently there isn't a document that holds the info, however here is a short list of features/things that the bots do- **TEC-Automation/TEC Bot**(*note- this bot might be archived soon, and all of it's functionalities shifted to the Welcome Bot) - Keep track of users joining and leaving the server. Assigns the New Member role, and removes it after 14-15 days of membership in the server. - Discord Forms. (this bot has a reproducible form implemented, so we can make many different forms with the bot... *I didn't get around to make the config for this though) - Praise-scrape(Scrapes all the praise sent in a particular channel, or in the whole server) - Mass-ban and identify bot attack accounts(the ones which use the same name) - TrustedSeed form(*this is incomplete and broken) **Welcome Bot**(it's named verifier *at the moment*) - This handles the drop-down question for human verification. - This handles the guide channel, and the walkthrough flow with the buttons **Old Welcome Bot** (it's the old Welcome Bot, that runs the Survey form) - Might be archived and shifted to the new **Welcome Bot**, or to a web form?

Currently there isn't a document that holds the info, however here is a short list of features/things that the bots do- **TEC-Automation/TEC Bot**(*note- this bot might be archived soon, and all of it's functionalities shifted to the Welcome Bot) - Keep track of users joining and leaving the server. Assigns the New Member role, and removes it after 14-15 days of membership in the server. - Discord Forms. (this bot has a reproducible form implemented, so we can make many different forms with the bot... *I didn't get around to make the config for this though) - Praise-scrape(Scrapes all the praise sent in a particular channel, or in the whole server) - Mass-ban and identify bot attack accounts(the ones which use the same name) - TrustedSeed form(*this is incomplete and broken) **Welcome Bot**(it's named verifier *at the moment*) - This handles the drop-down question for human verification. - This handles the guide channel, and the walkthrough flow with the buttons **Old Welcome Bot** (it's the old Welcome Bot, that runs the Survey form) - Might be archived and shifted to the new **Welcome Bot**, or to a web form?

_25-Oct-21 03:01 PM_:

Thanks, @Vyvy-vi. That's super helpful. So the guide that we have now on your test server is using the Welcome Bot, right?

@Edu - TEC Steward., @Tam2140, and @chuygarcia.eth - one of the things we touched while working on the Discord menu changes is having the TEC Twitter profile point here (along w/ the TEC website), rather than to snapshot. Seems like a logical move as a way to better build community, right? Assuming we all agree, what would it take to make that happen?

Sharing this here. This is data regarding the community behavior in Discord and a bit of the forum. The idea would be to see how this data gets affected after the change of the new discord and onboarding journey. @MS @LBS (edited)

Hey Friendos, as requested I updated the Miro board to reflect the conversations we had at Monday's meeting. The visual is updated and there is also a Notes section that puts all the flows into text form too. As well as a list of action items that jumped out to me. I think clicking the link below should give you access to comment.

One thing I've noticed is that the asking seems to outweigh the giving. So we're asking for all this information from newcomers but the giving back to newcomers part seems unclear. Some questions that may help: - Will the survey tell them that someone will be reaching out to them? - How long would the wait be until then? - What can they do for now until that happens? - Who will be reaching out to them(so they know it's not a scam/spam)? - What sort of information should they expect to receive? - What should they expect in one-on-one calls with whoever is reaching out to them? (minimum expectation of value from the call) - Have they been made sufficiently aware how the data they put into the survey will be used? - Who has access to this data? Are we sufficiently doing our part to keep their data safe? (edited)

Forefront has a good approach to determining pronoun preferences. You click on an emoji to set a role with your corresponding preference and then it shows up anytime someone clicks on your profile. Not everyone has to do it, but it is an option that is prominently displayed in the welcome section and so many do do it.

I have a contrarian view on public display of survey data. There is a balance between respect for privacy and transparency. When I answer survey data, I don't expect my answers to be on public display for anyone in the world to see. It's one thing if I introduce myself by typing that same information in a Discord channel, but I have grown accustomed to feeling like answers to a survey are not generally public matters. I think we need to be careful here.

I see a distinction between doing something where I act in a role as a TEC member, which should be public and transparent, and doing something in a private, personal capacity, such as providing personal information. In that latter case, I think we need to be careful to err more on the side of privacy, whereas on the former we should err toward transparency. My two cents.

_01-Nov-21 10:02 AM_:

That can be implemented, and is a neat way to go about with this. My question is, where do we place such a pronoun selection menu, in the server in a way that it doesn't affect the onboarding process? Maybe, we can make a channel, called #role-select, where people can select pronouns, and maybe we can have a similar menu for selecting "expertise"/"WG alignment"... If we do set this up, maybe it would be easier to accommodate the "Creatives Sorting process", that Chuy and Manu suggested, as it is needed by the Comms WG?


Personally, I'm not sure if we should put it in the survey since (*maybe*) some people would not want to get the role but do want to fill the pronouns into the survey (edited)

_01-Nov-21 10:52 AM_:

Forefront implemented it as its own channel in a welcome section.

The call it pronoun-roles but we could probably come up with a more descriptive name for it.

Ah, I think I missed the point @nic is making. Agreed. We should disclose who has access to the data, for sure.

An interesting look at the different roles that RabbitHole is developing for member engagement as it transitions into a DAO. (should I share info like this here - or someplace else? Don't want to distract from our actual work but it's interesting to see what others are doing).

Let‚Äôs face it. Crypto onboarding as we know it is a tedious process plagued by token shillers and speculators whose only mission is to pump their own bags. And aside from centralized products like Coinbase Earn, there‚Äôs no education network dedicated to teaching users the ins and outs of on-chain interactions.

Metagame has something similar where you select roles and then someone reaches out to you based on the roles you picked. They send you a link to quests to do, varying in levels of effort needed.

We could do a mini onboarding quest where they go through each channel and select what fits them, 1 is pronouns, 2 is interests, 3 is skills

I see lots of potential here and it could make it fun and very engaging. This weekend I was thinking a lot about engagement ladders and this is very related. We could even build sequential engagement ladders out of these roles and various quests. At least for lower levels of more prescribed community engagement.

This a very cool idea, we can FOR SURE, work on that for the second version of the onboarding journey. Because right now we do have those 3 parts but on a more passive way. The ideal sceneario is to make it simple and quick, so people don't feel overhwealmed with the "quests"

Just went through the Tally.cash discord onboarding. They onboard into 4 diff dog packs and newcomers get a poap of their dog (nice touch!). This all sounds a little silly maybe but it was a fun quiz to take and the outcome is onboaridng in to 4 diff "smaller" groups of cohorts. The idea is intruiging.

How to DAO 201: Onboarding as Wayfinding ‚Äî Mirror

Welcome to the second deep dive on how we are building CabinDAO. In this article we‚Äôll cover how onboarding differs from traditional corporate environments. Then we‚Äôll break down current onboarding practices and offer digital-native ideas. Finally, we‚Äôll share how a few leading DAOs, including Cabin, are building their new member journeys.

New digital native cities are emerging: first in the form of digital spaces (e.g. DAOs), and soon as physical expressions of their communities. At Forefront we are developing the port of entry, a digital city unto itself.

_08-Nov-21 03:09 PM_:

Sure, @LBS. This is the challenge with all knowledge management: schema standardization. The struggle is early on it's good to have flexibility while the field is growing and changing (which is why a CRM database is tough), but then if it's too flexible it becomes really tough to use because there's no standards. I'm playing with templates in Roam as a way around that and there are some folks w/ some good ideas on that front. On a separate front, also looking at Obsidian, which seems to be further along the IPFS integration path for something that could be more decentralized -- down the road. I'm generally around this week though for a chat. Will drop you a note.

Hey friendos, just a quick personal update: I mentioned this briefly in our call today, but wanted to share for those who weren't there. So far, y'all have known me while I've been in my "go-mode" (aka hypomania) where I am full of energy and focus. Now I'm transitioning to the opposite "low-state" where I struggle more with foggy-brain, overwhelm, and sometimes depression. During my low-state, I transition to focusing primarily on caring for myself and my wellbeing over doing work. This simply means that I'll be less intense and fast with my contributions. I still intend to go to most Communitas meetings, but I'm less available for async work sessions or projects during the week. Please still feel free to use and interact with the work I've already done, and/or reach out to me in DMs with questions and ideas. Just keep in mind that I'll be slower to respond than I was before, so don't wait on me to expand your ideas.

I'm in the midst of drafting the article we talked about focused on TEC onboarding and the mix of automation and personal touch. Should have a draft to look at early next week (and will ping you @MS and @Vyvy-vi, since you were the catalysts). In the meantime, I just published this piece on my own Medium account (after not writing for nearly 2 years). The focus is on why I've decided to focus on Web3 and TEC in particular.

@MS I'm curious if you have have seen this visualization yet. The communitas group was mentioning making it more readable. Saying key words like: contrast and whatnot, made me think of you friend. I think they have it sorted out but I am unsure if they require any assistance. For context @liviade, If you don't know this detail already MS is a accessibility wizard and has a whole crew of equally heart centered champions in their corner. We've stirred up conversations about putting together accessibility drop in workshops. MS's skills translate deeply across the whole scope of the project from my vantage.

1/n - Every DAO needs a homebase. A place for contributors, members, and explorers to get a high-level view of what the DAO is working on, who's involved, and where things are trending. Interesting. Forefront is rolling out something like the dashboard idea. @nic FYI.

awww I‚Äôm really eager to start <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f605.png" width=20 height=20>

But it‚Äôs got to go through advice process, feedback and proposals first! I am working on DAO tooling outside of the TEC with my friend though. As for the TEC, been thinking of creating a design system so that at least whenever anyone wants to make something for the TEC it can help them hit the ground running for dev. Just ideas at this point though <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f601.png" width=20 height=20>

There‚Äôs places it could be improved but think it‚Äôs good enough for gathering community feedback. A focused session would be great though maybe we can do it in another Sprint l? At the time when we have to finalize the proposal o post to Conviction Voting! It‚Äôs not far now!!

I won‚Äôt be able to make it to the call but here are my notes: -

*advice I wish I didn‚Äôt receive*

- only the ones that are unsolicited. Otherwise I like experimenting and trying things out or reflecting back to a time I have done that thing they‚Äôre advising me to do -

*guides on guides*

- looks really easy to follow! from my experience in answering questions from newcomers is when they already have a project in mind and need help with that project. For me it feels like we‚Äôre just directing them to a working group which typically already have projects happening so it almost feels like they didn‚Äôt get the help they needed -

I won‚Äôt be able to make it to the call but here are my notes: - *advice I wish I didn‚Äôt receive* - only the ones that are unsolicited. Otherwise I like experimenting and trying things out or reflecting back to a time I have done that thing they‚Äôre advising me to do -*guides on guides*- looks really easy to follow! from my experience in answering questions from newcomers is when they already have a project in mind and need help with that project. For me it feels like we‚Äôre just directing them to a working group which typically already have projects happening so it almost feels like they didn‚Äôt get the help they needed -*community call presentation* - it was sooo great  you‚Äôre all amazing ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è -*how am i* - doing good!

I am defying my instincts and intentionally sharing it before it's gone through a full editing pass - just to encourage your bigger picture feedback. One thing to note is that I haven't gone with a "just the facts" approach. Instead, I'm building on the idea of "permissionless organizations" and how that shapes the challenge we face with onboarding newcomers. My hope is that this perspective will pique some broader interest for this piece and give some broader exposure to what we're doing. OK, here it is:

[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CdQ8g5ynridpanDxyJ0NwXT3psKZc9XXIh3v5KlftDA/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CdQ8g5ynridpanDxyJ0NwXT3psKZc9XXIh3v5KlftDA/edit?usp=sharing)

It'd be great if I could get feedback by the end of the week, so I can clean it up and publish it next week. @natesuits, does that work for you timing-wise?

An excellent piece, @Gideonro! I enjoyed the insights you're highlighted, like how simplyfing and routinizing was keys to past success and are still important but insufficient for onboarding into DAOs. I found the examples you share, as well, to be good choises to demostrate a larger meaning: the guide = avoid overwhelm, one-step-at-a-time and pronoun-roles = the warmth and spirit of *bring you exactly as you are*. I'm with @natesuits on green light go! (edited)

I forgot to provide feedback. I really like it. The only thing maybe that could be interested to add, is an screenshot of the survey, the same way you add it the visualization for the Guide  <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f604.png" width=20 height=20>

Thanks, @Tam2140. I'm glad it resonates. I'll do some clean up between now and Monday in case anyone else has more feedback. @natesuits, I'll shoot for Tuesday to publish it.

Shall we dedicate a channel for Education? Create a new channel under community where we drop links and ping resources for education related to web3? We have TE Academy butt they don't cover all the spectrum necessary i believe @durgadas @MS @LBS @Tam2140 @ALOYSIOUS, what do you think?

Also, I haven't had my coffee yet - am I missing someone who also played a key role?

Thank you for your feedback <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f64f.png" width=20 height=20>

Have you been helped yet? If not, you could start by learning from the Token Engineering Academy sessions here

[https://youtube.com/c/TokenEngineering](https://youtube.com/c/TokenEngineering)

starting from the oldest video. Do you prefer reading? If so let me know I can try to find resources for you. I would also recommend joining the params parties happening in every working group this week. During params parties, you can learn about the different parameters which you may have to think about for your project. You can find more things to consider when designing the tokenomics of your projects by hearing others‚Äô perspectives on why they believe their design parameters are best for the TEC economy. The #üéëÔΩúomega working group can also bring up more things to consider from the ethics side of designing an economy that will affect many other humans. I hope you find this helpful. Let me know if you have any further questions. The TEC is ever evolving and we hope to be more helpful to you in the future.

Token Engineering

The Challenge Creating tokenized ecosystems is hard. How do we figure out what we want? How do we manifest that intent with block rewards and other crypto building blocks? How do we simulate and validate the design? How do we anticipate attacks and respond to them? How do we update the protocols? Given that these systems are wildly powerful, how...

Thank you for your feedback  Have you been helped yet? If not, you could start by learning from the Token Engineering Academy sessions here <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f64f.png" width=20 height=20>

[https://youtube.com/c/TokenEngineering](https://youtube.com/c/TokenEngineering)

starting from the oldest video. Do you prefer reading? If so let me know I can try to find resources for you. I would also recommend joining the params parties happening in every working group this week. During params parties, you can learn about the different parameters which you may have to think about for your project. You can find more things to consider when designing the tokenomics of your projects by hearing others‚Äô perspectives on why they believe their design parameters are best for the TEC economy. The #üéëÔΩúomega working group can also bring up more things to consider from the ethics side of designing an economy that will affect many other humans. I hope you find this helpful. Let me know if you have any further questions. The TEC is ever evolving and we hope to be more helpful to you in the future.

Yeah I have been reading up on different token engineering content, even a book on token economics but honestly I found it a little disorganized for a practitioner designing their economy. So if you know of stuff, that'd be great.

I didn't realize the params parties was what you described! haha, I think for me, since I've done a fair amount of work on it so far, the best is getting *informed* feedback

Aha! Great, that's good to know. Yes, then the Academy is where I want to go: I think people can learn about Token Engineering when seeing how other tokenomics are being built. Focusing on the token engineering of a single project can be useful, but not as much I think

But it was confusing because during the onboarding call, I said I was working on a project and someone leading it said to present in Communitas

So that doesn't make super sense in this context...are param parties a place to do so?

It seems like, if this discord is about token engineering, finding the space to talk about specific projects is the most useful exercise across all use cases

but not all working group meetings are like that. This week many working groups are doing a params party instead of their usual meetings I‚Äôm assuming to promote informed participation of designing the TEC economy. If you were recommended to present your project during a communitas meeting then perhaps try another one of the communitas‚Äô meetings.

I think I am grokking where Communitas fits from reading the manifesto. So it seems like TE Academy is the place and there's both a channel here #ü•ºÔΩúte-academy and also the separate discord you shared back....or are those the same?

Okay I think I am grokking further.

Augmented Bonding Curve - Entry & Exit Tribute

Entry & Exit Tribute The Augmented Bonding Curve (ABC) allows for the Entry & Exit tribute parameters to be implemented as a method for allocating money to the Common Pool and to prevent excessive speculation. When an agent purchases (mints) or sells (burns) TEC tokens through the Augmented Bonding Curve, a small percentage of those funds are ...

Hi @satchel - PST and welcome to the TEC! If I am threading together all the previous messages it sounds like you (1) have started your journey to learning about token engineering, (2) have a project that you are or will be launching and (3) are interested in getting feedback and advice about your project. Is that right?


If you already have any documentation about your project, one of the best ways to ask the wider community for feedback is to post what you are working on and any questions you have about it, any calls for collaboration, in the TEC Forum.

Weird. I was *just* thinking about this today, @Edu - TEC Steward., in the context of how we get better about communicating important messages within the community. For instance, I think we could be doing better at using the everyone role for things we really want to rally attention around (like getting focus on params right now for example). Similarly, I think it's worth putting a little more thought into how we use new member. I just got an invite to Sobol and am starting to think holistically about how these roles and Discord roles might sync. In short, can we hold off on this decision as we look at it more holistically?

Okay thanks. I am thinking that it might be a faster iteration and some community building if I presented in a live webinar what I do so I can better integrate feedback.

Tks @edu. That's my hope with this piece. By not making it seem like an overt promotion of TEC, and by embedding some insights that aren't just about us, we can tell the TEC story in ways that spread and create a natural draw. Hopefully, tomorrow we can do a little push once it goes up on the TEC Medium and see if we can pull in some more folks. Super happy to have even one person join as a result of this though. Cool!

I actually think maybe a better way is for me to set up a small webinar. I can socialize through the forum and #üé´ÔΩúgeneral . I think the async nature won't give me the feedback so I can get this out the door. I am looking at the webinar platforms I use currently.

OK, this article is now live on TEC Medium. We just had our second person join because of this piece, and w/out much promotion. So that's a good sign that this strategy (see my above post) may be a good way to get some attention for TEC. It would be great if we could all rally in getting some engagement for the TEC tweet this morning:

@Edu - TEC Steward. u, @MS, @LBS, @Vyvy-vi, @durgadas, @ALOYSIOUS, @natesuits, @gene - any help you all can provide on that front would be great. (And note the shoutout to each of you in the article)

P.S. Clapping for the article on Medium should help build the TEC Medium account too. We still need to learn more about how that works. (edited)

I think one thing we could look into is ramp up our announcement game (I think besides the twitter, and parties there's a lack of direct info going to many people) And even besides discord, maybe a newsletter of-sorts can be beneficial?

+1 on newsletter. It's been an idea for a while but not yet executed. I think we now have all the components in place with Hubspot. @natesuits do you know more?

I like this tweet: Making the jump to working for a DAO can be a challenge. I've helped dozens of newbies into the space over these past 18 months and the thing that is often most difficult for them is this simple question: "What should I do?" <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f914.png" width=20 height=20>

Here's a thread on how to figure that out:

Hey guys! Thanks for letting me hop in to recruit! As I mentioned, PrimeDAO is looking for support in building long-term collaboration efforts with TEC in the style of joint ventures, collaborative development ect . A huge part of this is community building! Especially since TEC has the best community building of any DAO! Right now the Proposal Inverter is approaching the point that it will need some serious community building efforts. To get involved: 1. Check out PrimeDAO! [https://discord.gg/nnxFrN8BKA](https://discord.gg/nnxFrN8BKA) 2. Read up on the Proposal Inverter!

Dear Communitas ! I wanted to join the upcoming WG call on Monday. I had aligned with PrimeDAO regarding the position of TEC in Proposal Inverter's development . They want TEC to co-own the product and conduct community building effort. (So, Prime will be on the development side of the proposal inverter and TEC would be the community part.) Maybe we can add this into agenda to discuss how we wanted to shape that relationship ?


Looking forward to see all of you !

Currently, we'e relying on a "fork and deploy a new version" deployment since that's safer and prevents us from hosting a bot for many servers.

Hi Communitas WG - the TE Discord is not able to keep pace with our program expansion, we've experienced a series of issues recently (handling trolls, proper onboarding etc.) and know that the TEC Discord is so much better organized and set up. Would it be possible to schedule a 1 hour knowledge power injection with you guys to see what and how we can improve? Greatly appreciated!

I'm thinking it'd be a good idea to include a new button on the discord guide to guide people who are interested in investing in $TEC. Something like, "How do I invest in the TEC?" What do you all think?

We now have this purchasing guide: [https://token-engineering-commons.gitbook.io/tec-handbook/how-to-purchase-usdtec](https://token-engineering-commons.gitbook.io/tec-handbook/how-to-purchase-usdtec)

So, it would just be coming up with a little introductory message for the bot to frame it, and with that we could explain that there are two ways to invest - through investing of funds or of work. Something like that.

Hi, I was in the process of buying some TEC today, and I have a question on the pricing. Hope this is the relevant forum, otherwise please point me in the right direction. Being relatively new to the community I have not followed all details on the bonding curve, except I gather the price of TEC would follow the ABC. This morning the price was USD 2.29 on coingecko for a transaction of around USD 570, then this afternoon it was USD 2.90 for a transaction of USD 1.6, the past week it has been between USD 2.90 and USD 2.15 'ish just reading the price chart on goingecko. I tried to convert on the tec.converter this afternoon and it converts wxDAI at 2.93. The liquidity is obviously very thin, and high slippage likely as well, but given the "volatility" I presume there must be some demand/supply affecting the price level as well but all transactions are on Honeyswap only, per coingecko. And one would expect a higher price on a higher transaction than a small transaction same day in a thin market. Or at least same, if the ABC was the only pricing element. Can someone help me understand this better vs the ABC? And apologies in advance if this has already been discussed somewhere or is a stupid question as such. Thanks (edited)

The liquidity is obviously very thin, and high slippage likely as well, but given the "volatility" I presume there must be some demand/supply affecting the price level as well but all transactions are on Honeyswap only, per coingecko. And one would expect a higher price on a higher transaction than a small transaction same day in a thin market. Or at least same, if the ABC was the only pricing element. Can someone help me understand this better vs the ABC? And apologies in advance if this has already been discussed somewhere or is a stupid question as such. Thanks  (edited)

Coingecko will always read a little different - sometimes their prices aren't 100% on point. Also there will be a variance because of the difference of trading liquidity on secondary markets like honeyswap or sushiswap and the actual price to mint tokens directly on the ABC. I'm not fully sure but I don't believe Coingecko is gathering information from the ABC and perhaps only calculating from secondary market liquidity

Was told to tag @Edu - TEC Steward. and @Tam2140 concerning the following: I am relatively new here and am attempting to set up a wallet in order to participate in TEC (praise, rewards, WG distro, etc.). So far I have found two, maybe three, tutorials pertaining to this. One is the Hatcher's Guide in the TEC Handbook and the other is a post in the forum by @chuygarcia.eth . The Hatcher's Guide is okay, but the bridges and dapps are different than the forum instructions. I am less inclined to use other tutorials that are not official due to security issues. Assistance does not need to come from anyone in particular, preferably someone using a Ledger device. So far I have found the steps convoluted, overly complicated or maybe it's my lack of interaction with the Ethereum chain. Either way, certainly I am not, or will not be, the only one encountering these issues. If someone is so inclined to assist me I will gladly create a thorough tutorial for all current and future Ledger users and then can leave it up to the community to maintain. If this is the wrong way to approach this or the wrong channel please let me know and I will move this question to the appropriate channel.

Hi, I was in the process of buying some TEC today, and I have a question on the pricing. Hope this is the relevant forum, otherwise please point me in the right direction. Being relatively new to the community I have not followed all details on the bonding curve, except I gather the price of TEC would follow the ABC. This morning the price was USD 2.29 on coingecko for a transaction of around USD 570, then this afternoon it was USD 2.90 for a transaction of USD 1.6, the past week it has been between USD 2.90 and USD 2.15 'ish just reading the price chart on goingecko. I tried to convert on the tec.converter this afternoon and it converts wxDAI at 2.93. The liquidity is obviously very thin, and high slippage likely as well, but given the "volatility" I presume there must be some demand/supply affecting the price level as well but all transactions are on Honeyswap only, per coingecko. And one would expect a higher price on a higher transaction than a small transaction same day in a thin market. Or at least same, if the ABC was the only pricing element.

I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs the right place to ask or comment about this but since you guys were talking about user narrative and onboarding just wanted to share some thoughts.

I‚Äôve found quite a bit of traction to entering TEC as a whole, it‚Äôs clear that you‚Äôre interested and passionate about building but as a person trying to get involved and learn I feel like I‚Äôm missing a lot of access to information - namely proper wiki/docs.

Been joining as much calls as I could which doesn‚Äôt seem to be an effective way to catch up, not like I want to be going around interrupting calls when you‚Äôre trying to move forward :D.

And given that seems like there have been some internal issues I‚Äôm thinking that should be a priority. Sorry if this is already on the talks, still trying to catch up with everything around here

_28-Feb-22 10:39 AM_:

I realized this after I posted. This is about building the full ecosystem right. I have been working in the Solana ecosystem for awhile and have found the use of the term DAO being used for NFT Gate communities that are accruing capital and organizing to deploy it to advance and grow. I came to the conclusion that these communities are only limited by their ability to collaborate and not lose social cohesion enough to split. And from that I was concerned about the welfare of the ecosystem in the long term. I was pointed here and the tragedy of the commons was exactly communicating the concern I had

[https://twitter.com/LtLollipop9/status/1497381151681482753?s=20&t=H6Hy0rd-T7B1OvRB_BNAaA](https://twitter.com/LtLollipop9/status/1497381151681482753?s=20&t=H6Hy0rd-T7B1OvRB_BNAaA)

So I am trying to better communicate these new entities I call digital states

and working through how we can implement similar safeguards at the ecosystem level without enforcing any time of centralized structure that hinders the ecosystem from growing organically

very happy to find this group as I agree with a lot of what you are doing and HOW you are doing it

the gitbook was great and really a strong structure

but I want to figure out how I can take the work you are doing here and pragmatically implement some of these things in ecosystems not building from a controlled starting place

I can answer the last part, you can join our work sessions and working group syncs, it happens every monday 8PM CET, everyone is welcome. You also have the omega Working group calls, you can find their text channel above this one, that they also dive into the ethos of the space. For the other part of your comments @Gideonro i think is better informed on this topic

I realized this after I posted. This is about building the full ecosystem right. I have been working in the Solana ecosystem for awhile and have found the use of the term DAO being used for NFT Gate communities that are accruing capital and organizing to deploy it to advance and grow. I came to the conclusion that these communities are only limited by their ability to collaborate and not lose social cohesion enough to split. And from that I was concerned about the welfare of the ecosystem in the long term. I was pointed here and the tragedy of the commons was exactly communicating the concern I had

I listened and their focus is digital states which looks to be more of apply decentralized technologies to current states. What I am evaluating and looking at is Decentralized States. Which would be entities fully within decentralized networks of communities of people coordinating together to advance their cause/culture by utilizing a DAO (edited)

Hello hello! I‚Äôm working on improving onboarding to 0mega and I‚Äôd love to make the experience beautiful for new members. Just wondering if the orientation call process is documented anywhere?

Hello there! Yes, no problem! Before the orientation call, we do two things: we replied to a survey sent to people on their DMs when they enter the space. So we respond on the orientation channel based on their respondes. But the survey doesn't get filled by everyone, so we also invite with the role "new member" to everyone to the orientation call.

What could happen also, is, if in the survey we identify something relevant, then we invite two engage or to a 1-1

It's the subjective, but it's just like you describe. If it's an urgent matter, or if you are seeking something very specific, it gets responded privately but mostly publicly on the orientation channel with recommendations, pinging the person that is the SME, or also providing an 1-1 session as an option.

that was so cool to experience!! (edited)

!praise @Tam2140 @Edu - TEC Steward. @durgadas @Mount Manu for making the orientation call a great experience. You cared to learn more about the people entering TEC and connect them to opportunities based on their needs, and made an effort to make them feel welcomed and valued no matter their background.



cool to see the information delivered so I know what's missing from 0mega side in terms on onboarding to the wg. Thanks again @Edu - TEC Steward. for answering my earlier questions!

Looping in @liviade because she and @griff (üíú, üíú) have already begun ideating sybil resistant options w.r.t. our use of quadratic voting. Where, for example, one person holding 100 TEC could, theoretically, spread them across 100 wallets thereby nullifhing the purpose of quadratic voting. It is BrightID, I believe, that is the leading solution on the table. So there is already a move in this direction. The above use case seems very clearly to need a solution against actors in bad faith. I could potentially see Rewards having cause for a "proof of uniquness" as defence against gaming the system (more so with the quantitative rather than the qualitative rewards, so sourcecred vs. praise), though I feel that would be better applied as a response to actual manipultion rather than the assumption of. Maybe just to add a last thought - since you asked - is a balance to our right to privacy. Proof of Humanity is an extraordinary project but recording such a video is beyond what many people are willing to do, for legitimate reasons. I think it would be in our best interest to factor this into the considerations. (edited)

What are the areas open to sybil attacks now? MS wallets? Proposals? Praise would not be since that requires a recognized activity. Identifiers are a touchy topic in my experience. Unless there is an absolute need (i.e. one wallet, one vote; a token drop to Discord members; or any other activity that does not require performance of an action ????) these identifiers become overhead. They are certainly needed in some instances but must be carefully considered so they do not present barriers and/or are exclusive.

Agreed, privacy/anonymity is highly appreciated in web3, it makes sense to implement that only in the processes or things that strictly require it, like becoming a Celeste Keeper or on the Quadratic voting. Sybil attacks doesn‚Äôt seem like an issue for Praise nor SourceCred, especially on the current decision of not having SC on discord

Hey Edu! Yeah I'm learning I probably don't have the expertise to be able to do what we're looking for, although I think the current discord bot lab series will help. I think we need to sync up with maybe @ygg_anderson or @Vyvy-vi to see how to pull the discord info and praise info together (linked by user) in a single place so that we can build on that dataset. I just haven't had the bandwidth to coordinate that conversation well. Without much progress to present on we could discuss coordinating that effort on the call but I recognize we may be missing some key people on that call don't want to take up a too much time if it won't be productive.

I think it's mostly about quadratic voting, assuming that the rewards system is not vulnerable (I just am not deep enough in it to know). So, unless it's proving an active issue on the voting, probably best to just let this sleeping dog rest. I did ping Wesley on Twitter about whether there's a way of connecting the PoC to some sort of test or quiz. We'll see if he gets back to me. That could be interesting.

_14-Mar-22 04:04 PM_:

@Edu - TEC Steward. @Tam2140 about that last topic, I just wanted to say that I kind of agree more with Tam's point, WGs should be able to compensate the individual contributions people make without needing an entity like the Stewards to take care of that, what if the Stewards WG didn't exist or the next proposal don't pass?. Otherwise I'd consider that the WG is failing in that regard. (I hope I understood the problem correctly) (edited)

Hi all! Apologies for missing the call today. I was excited to get some advice on metrics. To make up for it, I will post here instead. I‚Äôve been stuck on the community metrics issue for a little while now. My primary blocker is getting a handle on the data in a way that would allow for linking discord and praise datasets at the user level. Praise data is already in a google sheet. We should be able to pull the discord data using bot but it may be a little while before I have enough discord bot summoning skills to get this part done myself. An alternative to a bot could be the Apipheny extension for google sheets but I‚Äôm still working on this piece. Is there any other useful data we‚Äôre collecting as part of the onboarding process?

Hey @bends! The Rewards WG has analysics of praise in their scope already. This might be a duplicate effort. Wondering whether we can scope a community engagement dashboard to Discord and Forum (maybe twitter too) for now. Does that help unblock. Happy to chat more about this anytime.

_01-Apr-22 01:45 PM_:

Hi Tam! Yes, I think taking a step back and getting a really solid idea of the audience and the outcome we're looking for would help. I was initially thinking this would be for internal use by the communitas team for tracking performance but also what factors may be linked to long-term engagement. I think we are already tracking some of those metrics using the stock reports from discord, but not in a dashboard format. What I was hoping to do with the praise data was to be able to link that with other user level factors, like when someone first joined the server, if they attended an orientation call, or if they had a 1:1. That would help look at what factors lead to long-term engagement.

I'm probably overcomplicating this issue. If we start with the metrics we have readily available, what would we want in a dashboard?

Not overcomplicating at all! That is exactly the right place to start - what is it we actually want to know/monitor. Just came across this: Discord's "Serve Insights".

It looks like the buckets they've already grouped like "Growth and Activation", "Engagement" and "Audience" seem like the right first step.

Edu did show Yineisy and I the server insights. I don't believe I have access to it though. This Karma tool looks interesting. I'm assuming you could use that for use other use cases than delegate tracking.

I would love to join this sync @Vyvy-vi @bends ! as Tam mentioned we are looking into mapping data streams for the Ostrom's metrics we were brainstorming in soft gov. @sidcode @mmurthy - showkarma.xyz are the Karma dashboard wizards - here is an example [https://www.showkarma.xyz/dao/delegates/gitcoin](https://www.showkarma.xyz/dao/delegates/gitcoin) - we want to bering some of those metrics here, the ones that aren't coming from praise. but we can also chat about how this could be integrated to the RAD dashboard @Nuggan

@Gideonro I joined the call after my last haircut of the season [barber is 8 months pregnant] I enjoyed hearing about a flow of sorts for onboarding to include education. I'm not a fan of testing but am a big fan in awareness training so to speak. This is where I see mentorship, upskilling and coordination developing. I'm curious what a conversation could be like with Level1. @RayKanani has been putting in a lot of consideration to the teaching / incentivising / self paced etc. Sorts of things. (edited)

@emmekwan @She__Fi 100% agree. Curation is the key. If you have the bandwidth and are interested, would love your energy and insights on #Level1 [https://t.co/UKPfXFWjVI](https://t.co/UKPfXFWjVI) It's a platform for community curated learning journeys to support onboarding.

@Gideonro I joined the call after my last haircut of the season [barber is 8 months pregnant] I enjoyed hearing about a flow of sorts for onboarding to include education. I'm not a fan of testing but am a big fan in awareness training so to speak. This is where I see mentorship, upskilling and coordination developing.

Happy to connect with @Gideonro and others that might be interested. We've been exploring community based learning journeys. We stay away from binary testing in favor of reflections. Our framing is that learners can contribute to the content of the learning journey by sharing learnings and curiosities. Reach out if interested in exploring together. I'll be back online on the 19th

@Mount Manu was speaking to some of the reasons people enter TEC // outside of contributing people are entering for consulting on certain things. What I hear in that is an opportunity to create a best of practices in the areas people keep asking about. A collaborative document, could start from a live call where people all jam on a written and visual products. Something like that could be added to over time as the culture of tokenomics evolve. I think this would allow us to better manage our time resources.

Sure, I am the Head of Technical support and work with ecosystem at Aragon, amongst other things. We have many potential DAOs that need more hands on and specialized expertise with legal, tokenmics, smart contracts, governance structures etc.

We could help them but we dont have the capacity to service each one and confidently provide the best expertise service, especially as we grow and thousands of users come in

This is where TEC comes into place as an industry leader. We would like to explore a partnership where Aragon could send some of these organizations to you to receive that expert tailored service

Of course these referrals would be filtered to match what TEC specializes in and the size of project etc

This content most fit here. If I understand the structure correctly. I just wanna share a very rough categorization of working group's responsibility. I think it is important to understand the overview of DAO components based on existing provided services. You can use this to think about what TCE currently has, what TCE will need, what can we outsource. #üïäÔΩúgravity is - [[Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)/services/Treasury Management]] "Sampo Analysts" is - [[Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)/services/Treasury Management]] #üí∏ÔΩúsampo is - [[Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)/services/Growth]] #üí∏ÔΩúreward-system is - [[Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)/services/Token services]] #üèòÔΩúcommunitas is - [[Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)/services/Community]] - [[Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)/services/Growth/User onboarding]] #üïµÔΩútransparency is - [[Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)/services/Operations/Project Management]] #üß©ÔΩúte-governance-guild and #üôåüèΩÔΩúsoft-gov are - [[Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)/services/Governance]] TEA is - [[Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)/services/Growth/Education]] - [[Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)/services/Growth/Research]] #üî¨ÔΩúlabs is - [[Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)/services/Growth/Education]] #üì°ÔΩúcomms is - [[Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)/services/Growth/Education]] - [[Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)/services/Growth/User onboarding]] I think we missed one.

hi commintas crew. the sampo working group and I have pulled together a high-level strategy for developing the "economic layer" of the TEC and i posted it in the forum yesterday.

Your advice on the Sampo strategy

Provide as much information as possible about your idea. This post grew from the Sampo working group‚Äôs high-level strategy document, which you can find below. The plan has gotten initial advice from the working group and was presented at last week‚Äôs Steward Council. To broaden feedback from the community, I‚Äôm posting it here and including a lin...

I've taken a spin through the discord channel header text and some of what look like the baseline/introductory pinned messages in some of the channels. I have questions around how to manage the incident/issue items in GH/ZH, but I'll follow-up on that separately. I've spotted a couple trends that seem to potentially focus our priorities in a couple ways. Multiple versions of the same information, and it does not appear that any are current nor they are the same copy between them. The example is a description of the working groups that can be found in the TEC Handbook, the TEC Forums (how to contribute post that is referred to in Discord, etc) and the Github repo welcome page. Incorrect calendar information. The example I found for this one is unfortunately the weekly Orientation call which is listed incorrectly in 4 places that I found: the TEC Handbook, Discord pinned messages, TEC Forums (contribute post again) and Discord channel header text. The latter issue seems urgent to me.

I've actually started sketching out the links between a bunch of different sources of information as well as thinking about an inventory of "critical" bits of information so that action on changing/reviewing them in the future would be optimized. Ultimately I think we would also get a specific list of items that were more of less urgent from spending a little more time reviewing some of the interlinked material. I intend to spend this time today and will be prepared to report more findings on Monday. I'm glad this is helpful!

@natesuits and @Costa can answer this best, but It's fairly involved from my impression

@nic I believe the Gitbook experience is largely inaccessible to our current community. The last update, they decided to go the route of Github mechanics, and while some are familiar with PRs and merges, a lot of people are not. From a community participation perspective, meh....from a management perspective its not difficult. Updating can be done by a handful of individuals, as long as they are given the permissions. Reviewing and Merging edits is simple enough, and the structure is always nice. There are many pros and cons with Gitbook. I hope I answered your question?! If you have any others, let me know!

It was just the fact that just few a few people had the power to give permissions. But as more people get involved I think this will be solved.

_13-Jun-22 01:03 PM_:

Yes. I think going over simply how to edit, how to comment, etc. is all content that should eventually be developed.

However, I also think that doing it for Every person is not necessary. I think those who are interested in Information Development, writing, documentation, etc. should def. be trained.

Hey folks. This isn't so much a job posting as an invitation for collaboration! dOrg has a need for a token economics expertise to help clients who require help with token/governance design, and we immediately thought of TEC and 1Hive communities! We're therefore looking for someone who'd be interested in joining dOrg as one of our active builders, so you can jump into client projects where needed and advise our Project Managers in other cases. If you have experience in token economics and token/governance design and you're interested, please DM me and we'll start a conversation! Thanks

Hey everyone. My friend and I are working on a new DeFi protocol that lets users add price protection and passive earnings to their assets, so that they can be protected from wild price swings while providing passive income through yield generation. This ensures that assets are optimised for downside protection and upside gain through a single interface. Here is our website to get a better understanding - [https://www.cruize.org/](https://www.cruize.org/) And the lightpaper - [https://docs.cruize.org/](https://docs.cruize.org/) Twitter - [https://twitter.com/CruizeFinance](https://twitter.com/CruizeFinance) We are both developers and designers and are on the lookout for a meme lord (community lead) to join the team who could help us with the marketing and community development. Developers are free to get in touch as well. Anybody interested to join the team can DM me or reach out at info@cruize.org. Thanks a ton, Samarth. (edited)

Hi TEC friends, I'm launching HERE Mobility, a Web3 protocol to radically expand access to personal electric mobility. If you are familiar with Helium, I take significant inspiration from what they have done in wireless data. In my past life, I founded Scoot, the first electric mobility app, which I sold to Bird two years ago. We are looking for contributors on software engineering, product, and growth. DM me if you are interested in learning more.

I'm not sure of specific quantitative studies out there that show the growth of the industry and need for specialists. But as someone directly involved with teams regularly building projects in the Web3 space - I can comfortably say that the demand is definitely high for these type of specialists and as a personal opinion I believe it will continue to grow at a pretty healthy pace.

greetings. Its my first rodeo. Im building a DeFi protocol governed by a DAO. Concept has product market fit and the tech will be good too. Just need to figure the token design/ tokenomics out. Anyone here with the knowledge want to jump on board or willing to help me out? Paid or partnership works for me. i have a model, just not sure if it will work.

Any individuals with tokenomics design/architecture experience please reach out to me.

_08-Jan-22 02:14 PM_:

Problem is I have more than one model depending on the route I take. I want to do a fair distribution via platform rewards but that means less initial capital to make the project successful. I‚Äôm assuming fundraising means higher market cap on TGE and less organic growth. Also I‚Äôm not sure in either scenario if my APR models for token distribution will constitute to a failure of the economic system when taking into account token price scenarios. With or without fundraising I‚Äôm not even sure what amounts I should initialize the liquidity pool with and how much of a buffer for market making is required to manage the validity of the model. I just feel that through the sessions I will be going further down the rabbit hole without building an optimal model. Without the support/services of someone with experience I feel ill just be trying to wing it, which isn‚Äôt fair on the community I‚Äôm trying to build via this project. I‚Äôm willing to pay for such services but would prefer an mix of partnership and paid service.

Hey TEC JobBoard, I was directed here from #üé´ÔΩúgeneral . I'm an account manager (cleric) coming over from RaidGuild looking for some tokenomics assistance with a project. In our weekly meetup there was a suggestion of popping over to the the TEC folks for an assist. If there are any tokenomic engineer types interested in helping the launch of a sustainable project (in the vein of Klima DAO) DM me for details. A really cool group are looking to incentivize the planting of trees through some Olympus DAO style magic. They are willing to share their white paper and other material so please let me know if you are available and interested. Thank you!!

Hey, there's a project looking for **Token Engineers**: "I am the CEO of Eroverse.io, an adult gaming platform that is currently being developed. Our token $ERO has been launched on Dec 15th. All transactions have 8% tax: 4% goes to marketing wallet, 3% to the rewards pool and 1% are reflections. In 2 weeks are going to launch our adult gaming platform. The basic idea is that $ERO holders that hold a certain amount of tokens will be able to access the aplication, where based on other requisites, they'll be able to play games, some with play2earn mechanics. The games with play2earn system will have achievements defined, each of which will trigger a reward amount in BNB to be sent from our rewards pool to the player. Developers can launch and sell NFTs to get income and we would keep a certain amount as royalties. We need to figure out the economy for the platform. Since the rewards pool is filled from the transactions, is higly dependant on trading volume. Calculations for individual rewards amount, variables to adjust to market changes, etc, need to be defined to make the system sustainable. Some % of the rewards pool is also to be distributed between developers on a monthly basis. Our token contract allows us to change the tax %" Anyone interested in the job? I can put u in direct contact with this person. Please DM me, otherwise the conversation might get lost. (edited)

Hey everyone, I'm looking for someone who has experience or knowledge with launching stablecoins. Will pay $100, specifically to answer this question: 1. How do you keep a stablecoin pegged to $1 on a DEX? If I provide liquidity to a DEX and someone swaps a big amount of the token, how do we keep the price from free floating, especially when it's the only DEX the stable is available to swap on and we can't depend on arbitrage. Thanks!

[Hi @mattishere and welcome to the TEC.  This channel is used more for posting open positions in the wider ecosystem. There are many here already and many other good resources to find work in web3. You seem to have many skills and I hope you find what you are looking for quickly. If you are interested in learning more about the TEC and Token Engineering, you are very welcome to join our weekly Orientation call on Wednesdays or our Community call every Thursday. You will find these, and all Working Group calls, on our TEC calendar:](about:blank#)

Hi All, I am a looking for a token engineer to help think through the tokenization of a community. The community is creating asset back NFTs in a segment of the market called Real World Assets (RWA). We'd like help mapping out use cases for the token outside of traditional governance. Prefer a experienced token engineer with references. DMs open.

Hey Everyone, I‚Äôm head of DeFi for a certain startup which is aiming to merge ethical and Islamic based finance with blockchain and web3. We have recently architected a staking mechanism similar to the ‚Äòvote escrowed‚Äô model that many DeFi protocols are using albeit with some key differences. It follows the ‚Äòvote to earn‚Äô principal and utilizes ‚Äòstake for access‚Äô also. Given that I‚Äôm not a token engineer (at least yet - waiting for TE course in Q3) , we require someone to validate and simulate our design and assess where there may exist flaws and where we could optimize or tweak the design and implementation. Use of tokenSpice would be nice. Docs are ready and smart contracts are ready. any TE‚Äôs that would be interested in taking on this task? Please reach out to me via DM (edited)

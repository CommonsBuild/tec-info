> The main objectives of the Community Stewards WG are to provide visibility across all of the separate work streams such that all Stewards walk forward together in lockstep to reach our high level TEC goals. Our weekly meetings are a place to check-in on the temperature of the community, to resolve blockers, to raise questions that affect the Stewards or the members of our community and to solve them with collective intelligence. We are agile in our planning and follow a 2-week Sprint cadence. [Weekly sync agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VQNgAThqMLaQrF21uoQabWelnyJKLtX-TbqOl8kVb0Q)

_22-Mar-21 01:39 PM_:

Hi everyone, Nate and I had a meeting discussing the Content and Distribution Strategy. Here are the notes from our call. We will discuss it tomorrow on the weekly sync. **Content Distribution Strategy Meeting (Nate/Marko)** • Using Zenhub board in a brand new repo with established content distribution lifecycle (pipeline) [https://github.com/TECommons/content-distribution#workspaces/tec-content-production-and-distribution-60549332d7d741001bbea827/board?repos=349409011](https://github.com/TECommons/content-distribution#workspaces/tec-content-production-and-distribution-60549332d7d741001bbea827/board?repos=349409011) • Allow both internal and external contributors to easily submit Ideas and Requests for content distribution. Create a link that automatically opens New Issue on the board with a pre-defined template (issue template draft already created) • Medium, Telegram, Forum, Discord (set up bots in between) Need to figure out who will build bots, whomanages them and how to propose edits whenever we need to address CD strategy Who runs the bots? We want to propose a change. Where can we do that? / ask VyVy and Kris • Medium: feature other projects within the TE community to publish on our platform and engage others to come to TE community • Decide on a central place where all our resources and information can be found with instructions on how to do something (Gitbook, special page on our website, can be public and pass protected for internal resources) • We will need to have a person to PM the CD process, Nate volunteer to take it for starters but… • We need to think how to scale regular contributors!

Is there a plan to move the comms content issues from TEC Coordination to the new Content repo? From experience with this, it's a bit of a pain in the beginning as there is no easy way to do it. It's manual copy & paste. Though in the end, it's worth that effort. (edited)

Last time we mentioned on the call it would be better to close all open and content related issues from Coordination and whatever new comes in to be created in the CD repo.

I've sent out a few invites to the repo so that Stewards can edit it. It's currently a work in progress and I haven't pushed the code for the call reminders since it had the urls for the webhooks(could have been a security issue). I'll start pushing the code after encrypting the links.

Heads up everyone! Figma made changes to how they handle Free accounts and limitations for projects/pages etc. With this new change all free accounts are allowed max 3 projects, files and pages. We are now forced to upgrade Team account for at least one member if we want to keep it organised all under one roof. For that reason I moved all Team files **back** to my personal account where I pay the annual subscription and we have no limitations of how many files we can create. That being said, some old links to Figma files that have been shared elsewhere will no longer open.

this bot is great! We're just still missing the Manifesto (is in the works now, see call updates for today TEC Community call) - and we can now start a new Agenda template, now that the exploratory phase of 0Mega seems to be through. Just quick clarification: I add the text for the bot in the comments of the github issue, or somewhere else? thanks!

how about work sessions? If I understand right, the bot works off of the TE calendar - so what's the catch phrase/key word for it to pick up an 0Mega work sesh or 0Mega wg call? Just 0Mega? shall I quit the insider joke with the 0 ?! <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f604.png" width=20 height=20>

@Vyvy-vi is it related to the connectivity troubles that Discord experienced today?

_03-Jun-21 12:06 PM_:

Hey all and @griff (💜, 💜) - last week in the Community Call there were people that could not get in (notably, the spotlight that night) so if we are full house again tonight, we might have to ask people to turn off their videos so that more people can join the channel. (There is some relationship between number of videos and max people that can join though I'm not exactly sure what the numbers are).

_04-Jun-21 06:55 AM_:

Hi all! In light of Eth CC in Paris in July, here are the new rules on traveling to France as of June 9:

Permissions to travel to France:

Countries are grouped into three colors.

GREEN - EU, Switzerland, Australia, South Korea, Israel, Japan, Lebanon, New Zealand, Singapore: no PCR requirement if fully vaccinated

ORANGE - Most other countries including UK and US: 72 h PCR or rapid test 48h  vaccinated or not. If not vaccinated, travel only for “urgent and necessary reasons" ("motifs impérieux” which means death in the family, etc. with proof) and must self-isolate 7 days


RED - South Africa and India: "motif impérieux" (again, "urgent and necessary reasons") even if vaccinated. PCR under 48 H or rapid test. Mandatory 10 day quarantine if not vaccinated or self isolation 7 days if vaccinated.

_07-Jun-21 04:45 PM_:

hey @Stewards :) I would love your opinion on something! Celeste was approved today according to our forum voting process, but I'm surprised no one blocked it or even asked any questions about it. One option is that we did a good job on explaining it, or the other is that people weren't informed enough. Any thoughts on the legitimacy of the forum voting process as it is, or if we should review how we make soft decisions?

_07-Jun-21 04:51 PM_:

I'm also concerned but i would give it for good since people will have to understand the implications of celeste when we write the community covenant. We will also vote for it, and we can use it as a ratification of this vote.

Btw it looks like people is happy with the idea of using celeste, which i think is positive

@liviade @sem(🌸,🐝) I get and share your concerns, however knowing how the community works we might be okay regardless if we run some celeste parties as demos before deploying the final version. This has worked with the dashboard and currently with the hatch, what do you think?

_08-Jun-21 05:19 AM_:

I agree with Sem. People need to fully understand the implications of these types of voting decisions. We can get away with low voter turnout if we KNOW that proper communication AND education on the topic was presented to the community effectively. Also capturing the elements of what makes this decision worthy of a community vote is something we should evaluate. If we consider this vote to be legitimate on the grounds of community education and awareness, I would say no, its not legitimate.

hey @Stewards :) I would love your opinion on something! Celeste was approved today according to our forum voting process, but I'm surprised no one blocked it or even asked any questions about it. One option is that we did a good job on explaining it, or the other is that people weren't informed enough. Any thoughts on the legitimacy of the forum voting process as it is, or if we should review how we make soft decisions?

_08-Jun-21 05:20 AM_:

Thank you, @liviade, for questioning the unanimous yes vote. It's good that we are asking ourselves this. My yes vote was based on the following assumptions: 1. I have a high level understanding of the mechanics and advantages, enough to believe this is worth trying. 2. In the case a serious blocker surfaces, we can shift to an in-house method. 3. Proposals by @sem(🌸,🐝) carry additional weight for me, personally, because he is always so thoughtful and analytical 3. Trust in Soft Gov, Gravity and Commons Swarm to execute this in the community's best interest.

I agree with Sem. People need to fully understand the implications of these types of voting decisions. We can get away with low voter turnout if we KNOW that proper communication AND education on the topic was presented to the community effectively. Also capturing the elements of what makes this decision worthy of a community vote is something we should evaluate. If we consider this vote to be legitimate on the grounds of community education and awareness, I would say no, its not legitimate.

_08-Jun-21 06:18 AM_:
Thanks for raising this question, Lívia. I can only speak to my own experience, but I would say I did not feel informed enough to vote (I'm ashamed!) but felt in a case like this, I would leave it to those more informed to make a good decision. I suppose that is a lazy mindset (I am sorry I did not manage better; "overwhelmed" is a better word than "lazy" here), and again it represents only my own! <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f616.png" width=20 height=20>

_09-Jun-21 10:36 AM_:

from experience: "too little time" to follow and understand the implications, who is affected by these changes and why etc, of all the action going on is super hard. When people ask me I admit that I most of the time am not up to date. Maybe to have in the list where we keep track of all the decisions made, to also have with sufficiently enough time the explainer linked in that same document? I think it's a spreadsheet. and we can always check there to be upto speed.

For example: one question I cannot answer myself: if as a TE you contributed in TEC, but won't participate in this or in other CS hatches, why do you need to be part of the Association? If the Association is set up to provide legal protection for hatchers, why must TE contributors become members?

Maybe it is explained somewhere in the forum?

_09-Jun-21 03:54 PM_:

The Association was chosen as the TEC legal strategy by the legal working group for a few reasons : 1. Liability is to cover every hatcher, someone not under legal protection could be a possible risk/liability. 2. The Trusted Seed ensures value aligned Hatchers and has a single process for everyone involved. It lowers the overhead and increases legitimacy to not open exceptions. It is a choice to participate in the hatch under this conditions and anyone can participate after the Commons Upgrade. The scholarships are offered so there is no block for any trusted member that wants to be involved. Here is most of our legal documentation [https://app.gitbook.com/@token-engineering-commons/s/tec-handbook/hatch-101/legal](https://app.gitbook.com/@token-engineering-commons/s/tec-handbook/hatch-101/legal)

We call it in the call as we planned no matter how close the results are... Livia reloads live and boom thats the answer.... (edited)

Various other options that i see we have and some can be mixed and matched: #2 We follow the Disputable Voting pattern that we have in the Commons final arrangement... its called "wait for quiet" where if there is a flip in the final result in the last 24 hours, then there is 24 more hours extended for voters that havent voted yet. #3 We extend it 24 hours and thats it #4 We close the 2 issues that people voted on that are clearly out of the running #5 We do a full runoff over the weekend, closing all votes and only putting up Fire and No Aliens #6 We combine the votes for the 2 non-intervention and intervention (a horrible idea please lets not do this but i'm saying it anyway)

Any other mechanisms we should consider?

_08-Jul-21 08:31 AM_:
#7 We follow approximately what it is in the forum and Jeff and I hack out a final solution that is a combination of both proposals What I would propose is that ~50% impact hours from <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f525.png" width=20 height=20>

is counted as people's IH and ~50% impact hours from <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f6ab.png" width=50 height=50> <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f47d.png" width=20 height=20>

s counted as people's IH and the 2 amounts get added together. The 50% wouldn't be 50% but would be the % of votes that each proposal got.

@JeffEmmett would you be down for #7?

In this case, the top 2 authors will be invited to a hack session to merge their proposals together and commit to a collaborative result. - My bad for putting 10 votes there. I wish I had added a larger margin because we are still gonna be polarized even with 100 or 200 votes splitting first and second place

I think that the polarization shown is not going to change by extending the votes, because its a reflection of polarized positions around the community. I think that if we choose any of the proposals like they are, there will be a lot of conflict around legitimacy and there will be people feeling good but also there will be people feeling bad about the decision. I like #7 as proposes a dialogue to not foster polarization, i think we should try to flip this into a win-win escenario, and not a splitting decision.

both top proposals are a signal. We can't ignore that a large part of the community will be unsatisfied with one or another result. So why not looking for the optimal outcome for all?

_08-Jul-21 10:30 AM_:

Honestly, I believe that this whole process of now trying to change something backwards has added more conflict than benefit. I just do not see any option where at least someone will not feel confortable with. There is no perfect solution because there are many different cases. No matter what you do, some people will feel not being treated fair. I believe we should try to "compensate" looking forward and not backward. For instance adding the governance power and adding some IH to those members we believe they deserve some, but not taking IH from those who have them. Adding is fair, taking away is not, no matter if the system was not perfect, they did not design the system and were playing the rules. (edited)

Just look at the voting system right now. We are using a voting process and then when we see two options quite close in votes, we decide we need to change the overall result to take into account those not voting the winning proposal. I am not against that, but we are changing the rules again just because we do not feel the outcome is fair. When you vote using a voting process, you respect the rules in that process, if you do not like the final outcome you then decide if you feel represented in the community and decide what you want to do as a member and as a community, you decide if you want to change the process in cases where the top options are almost tied in votes, but you do not change the result of the voting, the voting process should not be changed in that decision, it should be changed afterwards for future voting.

Anyway, my final take is to add to those cases where the system has not been fair, I feel absolutely happy with that option as long as none of the IH already distributed is taken away, the final result is probably the same because at the end it is the relative amount what counts, but it is just the way of doing things what is important more than the final result for every single one of us.

Some people have IH taken away in Praisemageddon.. I think it would be a lot easier to discuss this if we could ignore the outcome a bit and as Santi says, look ahead. Right now, no proposal has a majority of votes. not even close... the top voted proposal has ~40%. This has been a horrible horrible experience for our community. I regret that we even debated this. I really do. We have an extremely polarized community right now. This shit is like democrats vs republicans in the states, it's gross.

We have to think about what is best for the Commons. #7 allows everyone to win a little bit, which is just the best that we can do right now. Instead of a clearly defined set of winners and losers, we can have both sides opinions represented in the final outcome. Honestly, this whole time I have been watching this as a train wreck waiting to happen, i never saw a way to push the car off the track... Amazingly, I think we can actually "Split the baby in half" and it will work out. (google it if you don't know what i'm talking about) I have had a lot of anxiety about this, and when Livia brainstormed with me and this idea popped out, it was the first time in weeks that i felt hope around this topic. That we could actually have a solution that doesnt completely just disregard a large swath of our community. I'm not happy about an intervention at all, I never thought it was a good idea, we should have clearly laid out the rules in advance if we wanted to do that and then stuck with them IMO it's too late to change the rules and decide to take from some to give to others. But that is not everyone's opinion and I really love that we have a community of diverse opinions. Looking forward, COMPROMISE is a value that will hold us together better than accepting the vile, false dichotomies of democrat vs republican, socialist vs libertarian, Good vs bad, right vs wrong. There is no "good" here, there is no "right" here. There is only best... Compromise is something I think we as a community can be proud of, and it is at the very least in the spirit of the rules as set forth for this process, if not explicitly defined as the solution for a polarized outcome.


Sorry for the rant... I will also post in the forum

I propose that this conversation be had in a public channel i.e. Soft Gov

since this decision affects the larger community, not only the stewards

for transparency

both top proposals are a signal. We can't ignore that a large part of the community will be unsatisfied with one or another result. So why not looking for the optimal outcome for all?

_08-Jul-21 12:21 PM_:

Okay great, I wasn't sure thanks

The community is split, and democracy is about listening to voices - if we choose a "polar" decision, this is basically saying that we don't want to listen to half of our community, regardless of "which side" of the debate you are on or your personal opinion. But actually, if we look at how many individuals are supporting, it is not really "half" the community as individuals as Tam pointed out in her analysis. I propose we look at how many individuals supported each proposal to have further data for consideration. The vote was about reducing the whale power in the system, but the vote itself is using the whale allocation which is at the center of the debate. Tam and myself suggested one person, one vote in the beginning of the discussion as otherwise, the issue of contention that we are voting on, is affected by the Token log process - as pointed out in our general decision space and governance discussions in the last Soft Gov meeting. Livia raised the issue of identity and not using 1p1v on the forum, but there was still some differing views surrounding this. In my opinon, using token weighted voting did not and does not make sense, when the issue of contention is token distribution. (edited)

_08-Jul-21 12:38 PM_:

Should 4 people in our community have more weight than the rest of the community combined? It feels like the 1%. We are trying to create better systems here. This doesn't feel like my economy, my choice. It feels like the choice of 4 or 5 people.

You deserve to be rewarded Zepti. There is no question how hard you worked. It's about how much, and is it several times more than others, who did similar amounts of work.

And it's not personal.

_08-Jul-21 12:44 PM_:

You could change anyone's name here and it would be the same.

Zargham always says "governance is a dumpster fire" - this is all an experiment. We cannot change the past, but we have a choice now.

For me the basic question, regardless of rules/systems/processes is: do we want to have a whale type allocation, or do we want people who all put in a lot of work in various ways, to govern together? Does anyone feel "entitled" to 2/3/4/5x than others. If so, it is hard for me to want to participate in a community where this mentality is present and overrules the more collective governance allocation.

I would happily "give" away my IHs to others. I wish this was the common sentiment and would make me feel much better in investing further in this community.

And that is just how I feel. Nothing personal to anyone.

I was a kindergarten teacher in a past life. And sharing is a very basic principle for me as I want to look out for others, not just myself.

We all work hard but when we work together, we create more value to be shared.

_08-Jul-21 12:51 PM_:

Sure I would if we were talking about splitting equally. I'm not. I think you should get more.

Because of course, that wouldn't be fair.

I don't think anyone is saying that.

"We propose awarding unpaid contributors a 50% bonus on their awarded Impact Hours over those who were compensated $100/day for their work (the typical remuneration rate for a TEC contributor)."

There is no easy answer. I actually don't love either top proposal as both will have challenges.

So what is the common ground? What can we agree on? And start there.

Sounds like we are agreeing (at least me and you Zepti ;D) on that people who didn't get paid should get more - awesome! I think probably most of the community would agree on that.

Maybe we start with what is agreed, and build on that.

_08-Jul-21 01:10 PM_:

I was referring to Tam's analysis - forgive me 8 in the context of "before the extension" "8 out of 30 voters (27%) cast 50% of the total votes." [https://forum.tecommons.org/t/pre-hatch-impact-hours-distribution-analysis/376/81](https://forum.tecommons.org/t/pre-hatch-impact-hours-distribution-analysis/376/81) "it would require 10 of 37 voters, 27% of voters, alone to determine the winner. If all other 27 voters combined, 73% of voters, voted for a single but different option, they would not have enough votes to pass it. Before the 24h extension: 8 out of 30 voters (27%) cast 50% of the total votes. After the 24h extension: 10 out of 37 voters (27%) cast 50% of the total votes." And Jeff's original analysis, which I know you were trying to categorize differently. The point is, there is a small # who have a large impact of governance in the builder's pool. 5/8/10 people in the kind of voter turnout we have to sway the vote that much, isn't a % I would like to see in a community I am co-vested in. That is my opinion. (edited)

I don't want to sway or be swayed, because at this level of polarization, doesn't seem like it will work. Rather, suggesting finding points of agreement, rather than disagreement as discussion topics.

What are things that we can agree on?

Hello, I'd like to share my farewell letter here and kindly ask if I can be removed from being steward.

Open farewell letter

Due to the recent community decision on changing the way to reward contributors the week before the hatch, I’ve decided to step back from the TEC community stewarding. My motivation to write this letter is that I cared about this community along all this time, and I think that when someone leaves it is better to say goodbye and explain why they...

Hi Sebnem! I think saying the 11 working groups was a way to describe it without getting into so many details, but it was mostly soft gov and the commons swarm that were holding the hatch because of the IH intervention and the final technical refinements :) we are almost ready now, possibly hatching today! thanks for asking <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f338.png" width=20 height=20>

_14-Jul-21 11:07 AM_:

Hi @solsista there is a "WG readiness for Hatch" checklist and zenhub list that we've been tracking in the Stewards call for the past few weeks and sharing in the weekly Community sync. It is to highlight all the remaining issues that would **block** us from Hatching! Since 0mega does not have any Hatch blocking issues, I defaulted it to ready. When we started tracking there were a number of working groups that were not yet ready: Community Stewards, Soft Gov, Hatch Outreach, Comms, TEC Params, Commons Swarm, Legal and Labs. And so these were really where all the focus went. Week by week the ready signals were given and now, as @liviade mentioned above, the last remaining task is the final IH list! Thanks for jumping in to ask and I apologize if you thought there was another step you needed to do!!

_03-Sep-21 02:01 PM_:

that's a good point @Zeptimus but I wonder if the signal on snapshot would be valuable if people know that they will need to vote again in the future

I see the advice process in the forum is working really well, perhaps integrating those comments and trusting that at least 9 people who liked it support it might be enough

what do you think?

im not confident 9 people isnt 88% of voters, but still agree with you vote twice isnt efficient, but a coulple of wales that didnt give a like could block it for instance

_03-Sep-21 02:23 PM_:

the people who vote, their vote will be valuable for signalling but i agree that some people might not even vote there since it do not have any impact

and voting twice it's annoying im kinda imparcial if we wanna do it for signaling or not wich decision we take, what do you suggest we do?

_03-Sep-21 02:56 PM_:

I suggest we keep promoting the advice process post, and that the feedback there is incorporated as you think is needed. Then you can post an update in the bottom with the changes you make in the proposal and the things you didn't add and why (edited)

we can have more debates in the community about them, perhaps make a few calls where we give like 10 minutes to each proposal, this will be great to feel the general acceptance too

I would love snapshot to be used in a more final way for cultural proposals so we build the trust in this practice. Otherwise we'll become too dependent on on chain voting methods to create legitimacy - lets discuss this on monday

hey @Stewards tomorrow in soft gov we'll have a discussion that came up as the Retrospective action for this sprint: is there anything in the culture we should abandon? does it feel like anything is holding us back? If so, how to make this transitions?

Hey @Tam2140 , you were asking for project managers on your wish list. I've done some work with @anna-marie , so that's one point of reference. I'm also just on Graviton Training, Cohort 2, and loving what you guys are doing, with specific issues I want and need to resolve. In the corporate world, I was project manager of an end to end product and service delivery supply chain where we added 100,000 customers at a major UK Telco over two years. I tended not to use Kanban, because I feel that project participants need "their own channels" structured using their own language. But then relating each channel, so channels don't become silos. I see that here! That approach, plus a consultative / collaborative mindset, meant a much higher than average success rate. That could have been luck, or some kind of instinct, but it felt right. My challenge has been and still is to adapt that to open, diverse networks eg in Twitter and Discord. Luckily, I love learning. Also luckily, there's so much to learn here. I can already see Gravity WG applications in other DAOs. I'm like a kid in a sweety shop! How shall we engage from here?

If you'd like to have a call to talk through the supporitng the Stewards WG it would be my pleasure. Does daytime CET work for you?

The cap could be based on certain data analysis / budget capacity. And it could be based on a fixed value, rather than TEC value, for example, 5K DAI, whatever is equivalent to that amount at the moment of the distribution. (edited)

Hi @ryeder (they/them) - the weekly Stewards call is meant to be a coordination call. There is a bi-weekly every other Thursday where we delve into a single complex subject. That call is really a discussion group and doesn’t try to cover coordination efforts. That is the meeting I referred to as the council. I can see how one might have found that unclear!

Oh hi Tam, thanks for clarifying for me here. I want to acknowledge that the notes are wonderful and have laid this all out nicely too (the difference between the two) and you are too kind to do it again for me here. Since I'm so new I'm not used to the cadence and having gone to only 1 mtg each - a council and a weekly - I couldn't yet differentiate. Also it was the first council! Congratulations on establishing the need for a council and starting it; I know you've been tracking the meta-process for stewards in order to make these strides for the organization. It's amazing to witness

**Human Verification Proposal**

With discord's new features and how they have been developing(ephemeral messages and interactions, slash commands), a new verification workflow is possible, which makes it safer to do it right inside discord and make it more intuitive, so that anyone could join without much issues :)

## What is this? New users enter the sever, and they need to agree to the rules at the screen that pops up before they could do things in the server. After that they will have to click on a button in `#verification`, and select an answer from the dropdown. If they answer correctly, the bot assignes a "human" or "verified" role to them ## The cons of using this - - This might not work for people with outdated discord clients, since this was added like 3-4 months ago. (*though, discord auto-updates, and is usually up-to-date for most people*) - If anyone gets stuck, they'll have to DM someone to get access. (We would need some people who would be interested in assigning people the 'human'/'verified' role, if they're stuck) - Random errors could crash the bot (this isn't pitch perfect as of yet, since my friend(https://github.com/nhcarrigan) like made this new bot in 30-40 mins). ## The Pros of this - - Waaaay better than the captcha site. The user experience in this method is super smooth, and ensures that joining isn't a hassle. - One solution, instead of a split-solution. (the captcha site was a site, plus a bot) - This is cooool! - Unifies the rules-agreement and the verification into one source, rather than needing to react to a message by CarlBot. - UserSafety and Privacy ++ This won't need people to use discord auth to sign up(which can be slightly scary for a few people). Nothing get's stored by this, and all data is contained between discord, due to which we won't need to make legal Terms of Service and Usage documents

Here's a video showing the walkthrough -

_01-Oct-21 01:44 PM_:

Thank you for making this so clear, @Vyvy-vi. Using this solution has my vote. Nice that Discord has added new features we can take advantage of now. This feels less friction-ey that the redirection from the website workaround we were looking at because Discord did not have a native solution.

**Human Verification Proposal** With discord's new features and how they have been developing(ephemeral messages and interactions, slash commands), a new verification workflow is possible, which makes it safer to do it right inside discord and make it more intuitive, so that anyone could join without much issues :)

## What is this? New users enter the sever, and they need to agree to the rules at the screen that pops up before they could do things in the server. After that they will have to click on a button in `#verification`, and select an answer from the dropdown. If they answer correctly, the bot assignes a "human" or "verified" role to them ## The cons of using this - - This might not work for people with outdated discord clients, since this was added like 3-4 months ago. (*though, discord auto-updates, and is usually up-to-date for most people*) - If anyone gets stuck, they'll have to DM someone to get access. (We would need some people who would be interested in assigning people the 'human'/'verified' role, if they're stuck) - Random errors could crash the bot (this isn't pitch perfect as of yet, since my friend(https://github.com/nhcarrigan) like made this new bot in 30-40 mins). ## The Pros of this - - Waaaay better than the captcha site. The user experience in this method is super smooth, and ensures that joining isn't a hassle. - One solution, instead of a split-solution. (the captcha site was a site, plus a bot) - This is cooool! - Unifies the rules-agreement and the verification into one source, rather than needing to react to a message by CarlBot. - UserSafety and Privacy ++ This won't need people to use discord auth to sign up(which can be slightly scary for a few people). Nothing get's stored by this, and all data is contained between discord, due to which we won't need to make legal Terms of Service and Usage documents

Here's a video showing the walkthrough -

I'd be happy to verify the hoomans. The slash commands look so cool for bots. I'll go grab a screenshot of the input fields on a bot that scrapes data off of discord thread to show what I'm excited about...

_16-Oct-21 03:22 AM_:

I would agree. I do not see the direct correlation with advancing token engineering. Are you thinking that sponsoring this event might generate good publicity for the TEC? Even in that case, I would fall back on token engineering education, research and open source tools projects being the primary recipients of funding.

gm @ALOYSIOUS ! New working groups form rather organically. There is no formal proposal needed and we have a checklist (thanks to @Vyvy-vi and @freshelle) that anyone can use to launch a new WG. It can use some refinement but it does contain the pieces of work to be done for a smoother integration of the new WG.

hey @Stewards as Zep pointed out this week, we need to look into Snapshot params for approving a proposal - I just made this forum post with a few polls inside so we can get this started

hi everyone! Only Zep and Ivy have given feedback here so far, would be great to have more opinions before soft gov tomorrow

voting on the polls takes 2 min and would already help a lot

@Stewards Hoping to move the Initial-buy proposal foward. It is critial to the Commons Upgrade but also important for the CCD params parties as it will have an affect there. I've nominated 7 Stewards for the responsibility of being the initial mutli-sig holders for LASERTAG pool of tokens. Please share any thoughts you might have before this proposal goes to vote in the coming day or two!

Hello guys, I have updated the Legal slide for today's community call but will not be able to be there. My folks age and health issues are making me have to dedicate some time to them for the time being and I may have to step back from the WG leadership. Shawn is up to date with the docs we where planning to work on tomorrow and I have also added them to the slide. I am sorry to have to step down but although I have some asinc time, I can not commit to any schedule for the time being. I'll try to keep up to date following meeting videos and news on discord and forum.

Hey gang. Just wanted to send a personal note that I will be stepping back from the stewards role in preparation for WG budgets after upgrade. Hopefully only a temporary move, but you never know. Life is full, and happily so. Work, family, play...not enough hours in a day, ultimately. Truly an honor to have collaborated with this amazing group of people and supported our growing community over the past 14 months. Little did I know the glory I would find when I hesitantly joined the very first community call. A steward? Heck yes! And the story evolves. Not going anywhere and will continue to engage as life allows, just relinquishing the stewards moniker <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f913.png" width=20 height=20>

Why only top Hatchers instead of all Hatchers? As I asked in the forum post, how does “more tokens” map to “better candidate”? Can you explain the criteria you are using for what makes a good multisig holder for this pool of tokens?

_01-Nov-21 09:16 AM_:

I think a better solution, instead of voting on people directly, would be to vote on groups of people

so it doesn't make anyone directly vulnerable and uncomfortable

and we have a holistic view of the final configuration

The way I see this working is: 1. create a bullet point list with all the responsibilities multi-sig holders will have 2. Send to everyone you would like to include and ask them to give a thumbs up if they agree to take on those responsibilities 3. randomize the people who said yes into 5 different groups 4. submit to snapshot a ranked choice voting for this groups 5. the integrants of top group will be in the multisig

I'm away from my puter for the next 2-3 hours. We should start with the goal and then the steps to get there. I have shared what I think the goal should be in the forum post by sharing the selected criteria. Others should share the goals and criteria to reach it too. My thinking.

this isn't really perfect either. what do we do if we don't have multiples of 7? do we change the size of the multisig? ie only 9 people say yes or 17, how do we split these groups up? how does randomizing groups ensure we have the best (most active) candidates

yeah you're right, randomizing might not be the best solution, but I stick to proposing groups instead of individuals

we could have a meeting to hack on the groups

Okay just to keep everyone informed we had an impromptu meeting with Zeptimus, Myself, Ivi, Livi and Edu to discuss how to move forward with the buy-in. We reached consensus around a **ranked choice voting** round to decide who will sit on the multisig - community members can nominate or self-nominate, nominee have 2 days to respond (if it takes longer than 2 days they probably aren't a good candidate. By this means the community will decide the members and composition (hatchers vs. stewards) the blocker for this process will be Livi posting a proposal and subsequent voting for what types of voting methods we can use followed by the vote for the buy-in proposal which will be a simple yes/no(/abstain?) quadratic vote given the buy-in proposal passes we make a third proposal for the multisig composition

What would this look like if was simple? We already have one nomination for the complete multisig. It's just one nomination. Let's get more. The rationale behind the nomination was explained. Cool. That's helpful for the community to understand and vote on. Why not have an open call to the community to submit “nomination sets” and explain their reasons why? Then 2-3 or even 5-6 people or even more people spend the time to consider what rationale is important to them for this responsibility. Then they find the 7 persons that match that criteria, reach out to ask and explain and, if all agree, they submit that nomination set. Then we have a group of nomination sets. And we vote on them. A monimation set if a group of 7 persons that each: - Hold one or more TECH tokens - Understand and agree to the responsibilities of the role The responsibilities of the role are (This is an off the cuff draft and can be improved): - Respond within 24 hours of a request to use the multisig. - Verify the allocation request was passed by the community (specifying exactly how would be useful here. For the present, let’s say it’s comparing the snapshot vote and the parameters required to pass.) - Alert the other multisig holders when you will be unavailable for a 24h or greater period of time - Uphold the values of the TEC - Spread joy (this is not actually a really real responsibility but it sure would be nice).

i don't see that nominating sets will be any simpler, maybe even more complicated than a ranked choice voting of individuals

looking in the long run if we can sort out this process we can set the standard for picking multisigs in the future

I dont like to create groups it also split between "political values" the community, you either choose this or that (or the strategic middle idc).

In this case, it looks like the community should probably have a say in how a group is selected for community multisigs (differentiated from the multisigs of WGs). Especially as this may not only set a precedent but may be

**The**

protocol moving forward. There are at least 3 options so far: (1) individuals nominate or self-nominate and then they are listed in a rank choice vote, (2) individuals nominate a group from all token holders (and do the leg work of assuring there is consent and share their rationale for the nomination so the voting community can make an informed decision) and (3) individuals nominate a group from the Steward group.

_03-Nov-21 03:25 AM_:

it seems "important things" to "organizational" aspects of TE Commons, need more active Stewards than the initial 3-4 hrs per week, check-in once a week, take care of a topic/WG etc. Just a thought I'm carrying around for some time now. On the other hand "operational upgrades", like using multisigs, funding etc. maybe require more participatory communication opportunities and should not be dealt in the same flow/stream of work as "regular" day-to-day getting things done mode? Also, please do not take my comment any wrong way, I'm trying to map the different speeds - and how informed participation can take place (from a more generic PoV, caring about multiple communities etc.). Imagine if people investing 3-4 hours per week, contribute insights, engage with the community etc. have difficulties with "informed participation" how is it going to be for any TE community member?

maybe a "better dashboard" ? A "catchphrase" in the post title, etc.

it seems "important things" to "organizational" aspects of TE Commons, need more active Stewards than the initial 3-4 hrs per week, check-in once a week, take care of a topic/WG etc. Just a thought I'm carrying around for some time now. On the other hand "operational upgrades", like using multisigs, funding etc. maybe require more participatory communication opportunities and should not be dealt in the same flow/stream of work as "regular" day-to-day getting things done mode? Also, please do not take my comment any wrong way, I'm trying to map the different speeds - and how informed participation can take place (from a more generic PoV, caring about multiple communities etc.). Imagine if people investing 3-4 hours per week, contribute insights, engage with the community etc. have difficulties with "informed participation" how is it going to be for any TE community member?

_03-Nov-21 04:29 AM_:

Thanks for these insights, @solsista. The original time commitments does indeed feel low and agree there is a difference between those Stewards that are more involved in day-to-day versus those leading more autonomous WGs like 0mega. These ideas are being fleshed out in the Stewards WG funding proposal. For example, WG Coordination Leads (WGCL) have min of 10 hours/wk expected as they are expected to particiapte in our coordination events. Most actually spend multiples of that. I welcome any thought or comments you want to drop in here as we think about how to fund the efforts of Stewards and the coordination efforts made. There are still some pieces to be better thought through. [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Df96GptjepEDRJCK4bI6BCnr0KfQNaPpVsMLCCb6qwY

shapeshit are also working on the multisig rn too

_03-Nov-21 08:39 AM_:
I was eyeballing the ENS delegate applications today and was thinking that self-nomination in this way - having each applicant share an explicit statement of intent - would give the voting community a lot more information than just the name on a list. Even though it wouldn't be a delegate applicataion but a multisig application. So

Instead of starting with a temperature check, we will be starting with a discussion about the nomination options for the initial buy-in multisig. @griff (💜, 💜) has volunteered to mediate the session and we will hopefully have as many Stewards as can come for that 15-20 minute period.

Who do I talk to about changing the lab times? I'd like to do the lab an hour earlier. I think that will remove a lot of schedule conflicts.

Hey @Tam2140 ! To get more people IN on param parties & playing w the dashboard, we're organizing WG-specific param parties and I'm setting one up for the stewards! Want to sync with you on when would be the best time. I could set up a doodle poll and ask stewards to put in their availability, or if you think one of the already scheduled syncs could be replaced by a param party - that could work too! lmk what you think is best <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f642.png" width=20 height=20>

hello stewards <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f642.png" width=20 height=20>

do we have a budget item function for something along the lines of petty cash?

this may not be something anyone thinks is relevant or important and if not, thank you for clarifying for me, but for the sake of brand consistency

i was going through the handshake protocol names this morning of our little ecosystem

this was a quick list

![https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/810180622634844206/919599508059480164/Screenshot_69.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/810180622634844206/919599508059480164/Screenshot_69.png)

all have essentially been claimed, not sure if by our friends or not, but certainly not blockscience or tecommons since they're up for sale. the stated price on blockscience is considerable, but on tecommons its i think $93 at today's rate, 360HNS@0.26

just putting it out there in case it has any importance going forward, the token is down 60+% from ath so maybe not the worst timing either

I think it's the opposite too. If the reserve ratio is higher it means the economy is more stable and its easier for new people to acquire governance power

(We will still have the Retrospective on Thurs. Jan 6th and it will be a general introspection of the previous days rather than specific to a Sprint). Happy holidays to everyone!

Yeah though I thought he meant that for the final debate time. So we may have a final debate in 2-3 diff timezones on Jan 12th. Whereas the fireside chat doodle we can prob make more friendly for multiple timezones. The feedback I heard was to whiddle down the choices to a few hours per day rather than have too much to choose from. That's how I understood it and probably makes the most sense since we can bundle Americas/Europe together, as we do for most of our schedule. We may have to have another to accommodate APAC though... since the three zones don't all work together.

TEC Sprint Retrospective Agenda

TEC Sprint Retrospective Scrum Theory : Scrum is founded on empiricism and lean thinking. Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is observed. Lean thinking reduces waste and focuses on the essentials. Purpose of the Retrospective : To plans...

The Commons Upgrade is LIVE!

Small oversight… there will be no TEC for the Proposal Deposit that is needed to make a Proposal. So even though wxDai will be in the Common Pool, and the Hatchers have Tokens to Vote; we will have to wait for the ABC to open so proposers can get liquid TEC to pay the Proposal Deposit. <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f926.png" width=20 height=20>

Hey @Stewards! Popcorn is starting its bi-weekly community calls this Wednesday and I'd love if someone from the TEC (doesn't have to be a steward) could join us for the last 15 mins and give a quick overview of what the TEC does and how you've just launched the first community-led hatch. Timing-wise, we'd need you there by 6.15pm CET to start (you'd be welcome to join anytime from 5.30pm when it starts). *Edit: I'm going to assume this isn't possible for tomorrow, and since it's tomorrow and it's our first community call, I need to find a guest. Reach out if someone would like to join another time.* (edited)

The window is open for the Stewards' statement of commitments through Feb 15th. The Stewards WG funding proposal is expected to pass in 1D and so I anticipate that the first round of distribution will happen for February. Please take the time @Stewards to share your statement before the 15th. And share any feedback you have on the post or the process. <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f64f.png" width=50 height=50> <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f3fd.png" width=20 height=20>

Stewards’ statement of commitment period is open

The TEC is launching the first “statement of commitment” period for Stewards. This period will happen every 6 months and it is meant to share that, as Stewards, we remain committed to the role and to being active and present, servant leaders in the know. Our Stewards WG funding proposal is live on Gardens and will provide a nominal compensation...

I am voicing here and cross-posted in the Comms channel - I feel it is not appropriate to use Twitter from the voice of a "decentralized DAO/Commons" to promote proposal/objectives (be political). Will Tweets go out to urge to pass *every proposal? Notification of proposals is important to keep people up to date, but showing favoritism or saying "this is our objective" is basically saying that every person in the TEC has this perspective, which again, I think is not the right use of this platform. Thank you for your consideration and would love to hear feedback. (edited)

_04-Feb-22 06:11 AM_:

A clear example of "co-opting" as political scientists would put it. When factions within wider rivalrous structures appraise common resources (in this case comms channels) to lobby in their favour. I'd say this is reminiscent of the "rewards discussion" or previous dismemberment of agreements made on rewards distribution before the hatch. Just saying because the TEC as an organic structure will continue to mimic its own flaws.

_10-Feb-22 12:31 PM_:

exactly @solsista "like two words colliding" because it doesn't make sense how these power dynamics crept in when our focus is on building something better than the current systems....especially since we are supposed to be caring for the people - TEs who are building these better systems based on learnings from us, and the people they are building for. What are we really teaching them via our behaviour? How is it a mismatch to what we *say*?

Hey, I was thinking about yesterday's conversation and I think it's a good opportunity to let something out that I've been thinking about as well.


After some recent changes and discussions at 1Hive, they want to focus on Gardens and organizational apps, so Honeyswap is somewhat out of the equation.

Maybe TEC (or perhaps a new DAO) wants to take Honeyswap and build some features for the Commons like integrating ABCs into the aggregator and many other things that may come out after some brainstorming.

One advantage I guess is that Honeyswap is still the second largest DEX on a chain that's building momentum, i'll just leave that there and hopefully it sparks some conversation.

I'm trying to build a bridge between DAOs and Liberating Structures community, basically through the TEC. I think these two scenes are extraordinarily value aligned, can offer bananas value to one another and I like it when my friends meet each other! In particular I am hosting a call as an introduction on Sunday 20 March that I'd like to invite you folks in particular and everyone from the TEC who's interested. We'll be exploring the opportunity space of how Liberating Structures can help DAOs with trust and coordination and how organizing as a DAO could help the LS scene. Here’s the event link

Okay so this doc is half of a Venn Diagram. In this half I’m introducing web3 Natives to Liberating Structures(LS) and this particular project to setup an LS DOA and Commons ultimately. The other half is a DOC you can find here, which is about introducing LS practitioners to web3 and this proje...

LS Commons DAO: LS community

Your contributions and acts of service to the Liberating Structures Community are a Public Good. I’d like to set up a (Macro)structure that will enable us to reward and fund those Public Goods of service to the Liberating Structures Community. My intention is to set up a DAO in order to Activate...

Stewards! I need some help! I'm trying to build a bridge between DAOs and Liberating Structures community, basically through the TEC. I think these two scenes are extraordinarily value aligned, can offer bananas value to one another and I like it when my friends meet each other! In particular I am hosting a call as an introduction on Sunday 20 March that I'd like to invite you folks in particular and everyone from the TEC who's interested. We'll be exploring the opportunity space of how Liberating Structures can help DAOs with trust and coordination and how organizing as a DAO could help the LS scene.

What I Need From You: Come to the event! Help me get the word out! Advice and counsel! Feedback on these docs: what is least clear? How can I green pill these facilitation nerds? This feels like an really really really important thing for me to be doing. Which kind of stresses me out, as I want to get things "right" (the very first time lol <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f923.png" width=20 height=20>

) and generally makesit hard to just try shit out and learn as I go. So this is me being radically transparent about my intentions. Who's coming with me?!

In our Communitas call today, we agreed that it made sense to share this document with Stewards and even ping a few of you who might be particularly interested ( @liviade, @Zeptimus, @griff (💜, 💜), @chuygarcia.eth, @natesuits, @Juankbell, @akrtws (TE Academy) ). This doc started as a plan for Communitas but the first half of it evolved into a bigger exploration of how the TEC relates to it people over time. This bigger frame is intentionally ambitious - not a concrete plan so much as a framework that can serve as catalyst for conversation, and then--if it makes sense-- turned into actual plans. I recommend commenting directly in the document as a first step in the conversation. Here it is: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U56cG2uAN2zPpDVEdDwVqlxjSFQMJ2KhDyrbCvdWvcc

!praise @Gideonro for taking up a very important thread in TEC: "Who do we serve and how" and start a conversation wrt operational excellence within TEC as a DAO as well as asking the bigger question of whether and how we can serve the higher purpose of token engineering by deliberately designing our developmental processes


I know two members, although they are not Stewards, have been upholding this question since they entered TEC, and also quite vocally in the past weeks

!praise @durgadas for bringing in deliberately developmental organizations and sharing a variety of frameworks and models that can be adapted for TEC and in TE toolbelt


!praise @nic for tirelessly sharing ways to improve the onboarding experience into the trandisciplinary art of Token Engineering, specifically alongside the TE Consilience Library, to make the experience be a "living library"

In our Communitas call today, we agreed that it made sense to share this document with Stewards and even ping a few of you who might be particularly interested ( @liviade, @Zeptimus, @griff (💜, 💜), @chuygarcia.eth, @natesuits, @Juankbell, @akrtws (TE Academy) ). This doc started as a plan for Communitas but the first half of it evolved into a bigger exploration of how the TEC relates to it people over time. This bigger frame is intentionally ambitious - not a concrete plan so much as a framework that can serve as catalyst for conversation, and then--if it makes sense-- turned into actual plans. I recommend commenting directly in the document as a first step in the conversation. Here it is:

What makes a "good" culture? Here's my best take: A good culture is one that is optimized to its business model and competitive environment. A <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f9f5.png" width=20 height=20>

on what that means. Amazon’s culture is famously “customer centric.” This isn’t because they are particularly nice or anything.

TEC operational efficiency/excellence should be "token engineering centric" for sure. Anything we learn about how to make TEC function better to fulfill its purpose is TE public good too, becuase it can be generalized and useful for other DAOs

it feels like a new thread here - or even a laboratory on the question "Who does TEC serve and how?" is definitely in order, I just wanted to underscore again @Gideonro that this is indeed the most important mid-to-long term question

and definitely second and support everyone who takes it on

the near-term goal has been get the infrastructure up and running and get the word out - we have scored that milestone and need to maintain it of course also mid-to-longterm, even innovate

_11-Mar-22 10:47 AM_:

I agree that this is an absolutely critical question. Is it just token engineers or is it broader? In that doc, I was using the phrase, " token engineers, and token engineering advocates, experts, and governors" as a kind of stand-in for a broader take that I think honors the multidisciplinary approach in this community. Getting clarity on this question is really important.

_11-Mar-22 02:06 PM_:

what stayed with me the most from this conversation is the importance of having a criteria to decide which projects we should partner with. agree with what @Tam2140 and @ygg_anderson said. Seems relevant to have information about 1. their economy behavior (value of the token, behavior of the token over time, parameters of their bonding curve if they have one, number of community members/token holders) and 2. value alignment with our MVV @Zeptimus @mitch (🍔, 🍔)

_23-Mar-22 03:15 PM_:

want to share this fragment of a chapter about copyright CC and peer production licences: "A copyfarleft license must allow commons-based commercial use while denying the ability to profit by exploiting wage labour. The copyleft Non-Commercial approach does neither, it prevents commons-based commerce, while restricting wage exploitation only by requiring the exploiters to share some loot with the so-called original author. In no way does this overcome the iron law for either the authors or other workers. ‘Non Commercial’ is not a suitable way to describe the required endogenic/exogenic boundary. Yet, no other commons license exists that provides a suitable legal framework for commons-based producers to use. Only a license that effectively prevents alienated property and wage labour from being employed in the reproduction of the otherwise free information commons can change the distribution of wealth. Interestingly, this is the correct application of the original institution of the commons, which was strictly related to material production (even reiterating this characteristic in today’s cultural debate sounds grotesque to many). The commons were land used by a specific community to harvest or breed their animals. If someone could not send cows to pasture and produce milk on it, it would not be considered a real commons. Kleiner argues that if money cannot be made from it, a culturalwork does not belong to the commons: it is still private property."

@natesuits just came across this image. I think this is the reason why even though we haven't found a way to get better ways to interact with proposals we should stick to CV in my opinion

Thanks @enti! I'm all-in for CV, but I also would like to see a greater diversity of treasury management options (voting mechanisms) that can compliment CV and offer different social dynamics that incorporate feedback mechanisms which could help improve the quality of proposals and allow for dissent.

I just want to compliment what @mitch (🍔, 🍔) said with the problems of the transcription - quantification periods are time sensitive, if 2 weeks of community call praise are dished at the same time, they will appear to belong to the same period and this is causing confusion to quantifiers. - @Mount Manu expressed a lack of motivation to do this task, which I think we can all agree to be tedious. He also said it's a non-rewarded task - you can speak more on it Manu, but it's important for us to look at how people are feeling about what they are doing - so it's an unpleasant task that represents a single point of failure for a large data set - + the point that Mitch brought up, the praise people dish when they are on a rush has been quite low quality and generalized


but we don't want to lose the beauty and excitement and high vibes the praise round has in the community call, so how could we slowly request that people type their praise, and be more mindful of it?

_28-Apr-22 02:17 PM_:

we do the out-loud praise in the Giveth Community call but *also* everyone writes it in the channel. I think we could have a transition period where we just encourage that, but still have Algene (for example) as a backup for new people or people who forget, and then just phase out the idea that someone will be writing it down for you.

I write my call praise anyway, but just... not in the channel. I think a lot of people do this.

_28-Apr-22 05:27 PM_:

Maybe we can treat call praise as a "feeler" of sorts, that gives people space to voice out the praise, but there's no guarantee or expectation of transcription? (though, we transcribe the praise from the recording whenever there's a praise audit or praise analysis to see if someone's praise slipped through the cracks)

Want to share the Amazon leadership principle that is directly related to our conversation about spending in the @Stewards Council yesterday. **Frugality** Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size, or fixed expense. All are excellent principles to live by, in general, but that one is most timely to our discussions. [https://www.amazon.jobs/en/principles](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/principles)

Calling all @Stewards and all that wish to join in the introspection! Why do we do a Retrospective at the end of every Sprint?

**Because Scrum is founded on empiricism and lean thinking. Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is observed. Lean thinking reduces waste and focuses on the essentials.**

️ Gravity is all on intentional, explicit efforts towards peace building and facilitation for cooperation

[vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin)](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin)

I guess the conclusion is, peacekeeping and cooperation-seeking needs to be an explicit effort rather than peace being an assumed default.

The main objective of the Community Stewards WG is to provide visibility across all of the separate work streams such that all Stewards walk forward together in lockstep to reach our high level TEC goals. Our weekly meetings are a place to check-in on the temperature of the community, to resolve blockers, to raise questions that affect the Stewards or the members of our community and to solve them with the collective intelligence. We follow a Scrum framework and have a 2-week Sprint cadence. WG Lead: @Tam2140 Discussions happen on #stewards channel All calls happen on #stewards voice channel Weekly call: Tuesday at 7pm CET Council call: Every other Thursday at 6pm CET Sprint Retrospective: Every other Thursday at 6pm CET Sprint Planning: Every other Friday at 6pm CET Stewards Manifesto

_04-Jun-22 01:38 AM_:

Hey @Stewards ! I'm loving the Proposal Inverter, I've had ideas on this for a while. I'm very much in favour of anything that helps DAOs to move across to systems that support good ideas, and the Proposal Inverter is a Rolls Royce of a solution, which will generate lots of data. It is possible, though, to get a much simpler VW Beetle version in the short term, creating a Notion table, and showing a proposal moving through the following stages and statuses: Idea ➡️ Team ➡️ Proposal ➡️ Project ➡️ Product ➡️ Data The Notion would point to eg Google Drives where related documentation for that stage can be stored. Why do this and not just wait for the Rolls Royce to show up? Getting into the mindset early would be an advantage to all DAO members, because the effect of defining and publicising project roles and so forth is an important skill set, and can be developed with either variety of tool, although I acknowledge the PI will offer stepped stages, probably meaning greater accessibility to more folk, and substantial quantities of data, which of course then has intrinsic value for research. I'd be interested to discuss this more with a TEC steward. (edited)

Heyy, thank you for the comment! Actually we are using kind of VW Beetle in proposal inverter’s development.

Thanks. I agree, initial models can be pretty simple, just I recognise the proposal inverter in the full form will generate some great data. But I'm always impatient, and wanting to move forward sooner rather than later.

Hey @Stewards I'd like to share the preliminary report from the polis we took in the Council today. Note that I have asked all the Stewards that were not able to join to also add to the poll so I hope by early next week to have more "complete" results. But let me just say, wow, this is a really incredible tool! Brings so much clarity to what can otherwise be a little fuzzy. Thanks @Gideonro for bringing it into the TEC and suggesting I use it for this exact purpose earlier this week on our 1-1! Very timely suggestion. <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f64f.png" width=50 height=50> <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f3fd.png" width=20 height=20>

This is a discussion group that meets every other Thursday (alternating with the Sprint Retrospective) to focus exclusively on one specific complex topic. This call is not meant for coordination, that magic happens in the TEC Stewards Weekly. Jun 30 - Facilitator:...

Hello @Stewards! I'd like to let you know that I'm offboarding myself as a Steward of the Legal WG and Co-Steward of Transparency WG. Thank you so much for the opportunity to work with incredible people like you, especially Zeptimus who has been by my side since the beginning. I've really enjoyed and valued the opportunities to learn as the TEC has grown. I'll still be around but not as much as I used to due to my primary duties at Commons Stack and Trusted Seed. If I can be of any support, don't hesitate to reach out.

Thank you, @iviangita, for all that you've managed to do as a Steward in the TEC. Transparency and Legal would not be the same without you. Neither would the Stewards since you are the one that makes sures the Sprint agendas and Retrospective boards are always ready! <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f64f.png" width=50 height=50> <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f3fd.png" width=20 height=20>

_06-Jul-22 05:38 PM_:

I just got a message from someone I used to work with who happens to be a Hatcher. They were asking me why the TEC is asking for more money from them. Here's what they said (I got their permission to share this): So why do you want more money from us? or maybe I don't "get" what is going on but I felt like I did all this work to contribute like $1000+ to the hatch - and I could bearly do it with metamask etc - (and gosh I really hope I still have the keys etc - cause you know crypto and normal people and normal UX don't go really well together). - why would I be asked for more money " to stay a member" I thought I "bought" into a DAO - was new to me that some how I could get degraded out - when I "bought" the tokens.

![https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/810180622634844206/994356623667638302/unknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/810180622634844206/994356623667638302/unknown.png)

I asked them to forward the message they had received and it was an email. See attached. We have to be careful about these kinds of messages. I know that we're (justifiably) excited about the ABC, but this message left at least one person very confused. It also negatively impacted their impression of the TEC. In this case, it happens to be someone who is fairly influential in the broader open source world beyond Web3. (edited)

This email came on the heels of a request for Trusted Seed membership payments too, so that is exacerbating the problem and adding to real confusion: ----- mmm... i guess I am confused So what did I "buy" membership in? or how do these relate - are they related?

I guess I was confused cause I didn't really track they were two different things - since I was walked through what I needed to do to join/buy tokens... then I'm like "why am I being shaken down for money"

This left a really bad taste for the TEC with this person. I just happen to have known them, so they reached out to me to find out what this was. When we send messages to token holders, it's really important to first run them by others as part of the advice process. That's what we did with the update to token holders a few weeks ago, and it made the message way stronger. I'm always willing to have a look at stuff like this before it goes out (and I'm sure there are others who'd be willing to as well). This is especially true when the message is going to token holders. We're working so hard to bolster the connection with them; the last thing we want to do is confuse or alienate them. (edited)

Tbh, I did not know Trusted Seed was a yearly membership until I started getting messages about renewal. I have also seen this on #🦾｜help :

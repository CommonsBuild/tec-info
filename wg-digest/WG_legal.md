The Legal Working Group aims to design and execute a coherent legal strategy for the TE Commons Hatch, bonding curve mints and burns and proposal distribution.

Scale of conflicts - Graduated sanction Guideline

Guidelines for identifying the scale of conflicts and graduated sanctions in the TEC This are some reflections we did in the first sessions of the Gravity Working group, where we were thinking on how to measure the scale of conflicts that can take place in the organization, and what can be some reasonable actions to address them, that can be se...

I found a piece of software that might help in situations where the conflict resolution and mediation rises to the level where it has legal implications: [https://resolvedisputes.com/](https://resolvedisputes.com/) I've also talked to Juan in Gravity about using something like this for case management in situations like that.

Making Justice Effortless and Accessible - Online Dispute Resolution

Built by and for dispute resolution experts, our online dispute resolution tool provides secure case management and file sharing, encrypted communication, reporting and more to attorneys, courts, and ODR officials.

There are a bunch of these, but this is the only one I've found with any blockchain in it

It looks good at first sight and something that is needed even in the current phase of design

Better yet if pre-emptive solutions/agreed measures can be imbued in foreseen legal issues

Hey #

<img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/2696.png" width=50 height=50>

- tec-legal I've gone through the Forum's Terms of Service and there're clauses which do not make sense anymore or have been left blank. Especially those in the Disputes section.

It seems to be a copy-paste that needs to be revisited to keep coherence with TEC's legal vision/alternative dispute resolution. Is there a process in place for this kind of issues?

Transparency checks as far as I see in the doc concern only availability and sovereignty around info/tasks but no mechanism for "deep/structural revisions".

Therefore the skillful leader subdues the enemy‚Äôs troops without any fighting; he captures their cities without laying siege to them; he overthrows their kingdom without lengthy operations in the field. 7. With his forces intact he will dispute the mastery of the Empire, and thus, without losing a man, his triumph will be complete. This is the method of attacking by stratagem."

Hi Folks, I spoke with a corp lawyer in Utah regarding the "incorporation" of DAOs in light of the Wyoming Legislature. He is available to collaborate. 1. The Wyoming method relies on LLCs which has tax implications and thus identification of people requirements. 2. C corp might be better but, taxes are higher. 3. PMAs holding the DAO and using a shell LLC for taxing and ID is plausible and a better way for annonymity. 4. Jurisdiction issues are resolved by complying with the most stringent regulations in your market and or intrastate/international treaties. 5. Alaska has a kickass corp statue, that makes its assets untouchable no matter what. Expensive to set up. 6. Ideal would be an offshore tax haven nation to offer DAO registration.

Historically, economic design has always been done with a top down approach, where the system is set by a core group of ‚Äúcentral planners‚Äù and imposed on the masses. Cryptocurrencies have made several steps to improve this approach, creating ‚Äúopt-in‚Äù DAOs/economic systems, but still to this day, every DAO/economy that I have ever encountered ha...

Donate!

wow

!

I know that for Trusted Seed we have to avoid the word "Donate" but its a different context

but a lot of projects definitely go with the "Donate" approach

and I love that strategy for legal... We should probably double down on the donation framing in our legal documentation if @Caeser (PST) agrees with that approach

I am a little worried about being too explicit with the donation framing in our key comms pieces since there is a lot of confusion already around the idea of how people benefit from participating, and in the end people do get a chance to participate in starting an economy and there are definitely some opportunities there... its a covestment (but no one knows what that means so we can skip that framing

It sucks, but I think it's an accurate legal take. Maybe if you're a billionaire DAO community member you could consider some other options

Hi @Caeser (PST). Yes, Santi did share a draft WG funding proposal for Legal with the Stewards. It is very straightforward - a reserve of 10K wxdai to be set aside for a quick legal response, if ever needed - but will need to be finalized and go through the process of being proposed and approved along with the other WG funding proposals. @iviangita has graciously accepted to lead this working group for the time being so that the docs you have shared and other next steps get done.

Hey there! I won't get tired of clarifying this: you can't make a DAO a legal entity. There are legal structures, commercial and securities laws + jurisdictions that will apply no matter what to any "legal wrapper you can think of". A DAO is merely a front-end of those.

HEY ROCKSTARS!!!! I'm with the SourceCred project I'm also a Trusted seed and Loving all the other places I contribute around here [I can't imagine you'll see me here in legal as I know nothin about this world] But I was here hoping to obtain some support. You see most of us at the project are all talented wizards at whatever we do but close to none of us are versed in legal stuff [unless its activism related lol]. Our project is sponsored by Protocol Labs and were trying to figure out how to set up all of our financials and security stuff. With our "Temporary Benevolent Dictator" having stepped down that means a few of our contributors have been gathering and learning and researching legal stuff to meet the demands of our sponsor in the transfer of ownership/power etc....Protocol has been chill in this process but they come with corporate vibes so the time pressure has been on people [as i have observed] to be pressured outside their comfort zones...I'm curious if anyone or a few people might be interested in meeting with some of us to talk about legal stuff around LLC / Foundation I have no idea what other key words to say here or if those are even the right ones...I'm simply hoping to weave collaboration here. I see my friends working really hard and I just know their mental health would be positively impacted by receiving some support if it was available. And I feel comfortable saying that we would value and benefit having a value aligned legal representative in our community to advise on legal things. [seems like a dreamy way to contribute to a project if you ask me...just get summoned and get paid without having to manage social status or time in a community in order to participate] please DM me if interested in anything I have shared. 

thank you for reading this

Thanks for sharing Livia! Unfortunately, we still don't have a lawyer in the Legal WG who can take a look from the legal perspective. May I ask when do you plan to do the community vote for the Covenant? Would it be okay to postpone the review until next week maybe? I'll try harder to find a lawyer who can review it hopefully. Also, is there any risk in giving it a go without having reviewed by a lawyer?

Hi, not a member. I missed somehow until now, also I'm not a dev anymore. I have a legal question about the commons stack. As I know the commons stack is a association according to swiss law, I also did find the bylaw, but not more info who is currently running this. I'm swiss and live in switzerland. I currently advise a carbon sink stablecoin, a DAO and we are looking for a legal structure.

_18-Jan-22 08:16 AM_:

Hello all, has anyone gained experience on how to fund a DAO with capital coming from a legal entity without violating KYC and AML rules? (EU) . The problem here is that if a company provides capital to a DAO and the DAO uses this to pay for services or provides any value transfer in theory the company needs to ensure that the DAO is not sending the value to people that should not receive it. That's what the AML and KYC are for. For a small number of payments this does not matter but if one would like to create a DAO and provide it with a starting capital and the DAO is intended to be a true DAO (in which the company does not have the last word) we have not found a way to make this compliant with EU regulation. Any suggestions?

[After reviewing the info on the te-legal regulation channel (all way back), I see that legal conversations/decisions on previous topics raised there are taking place in this channel mainly. 1. Q's on the "legal structure/back-up" of members, entities and future projects: as per understood, the Swiss Association is intended to provide a first legal framework for individual members regarding the "impact hours" pre-hatch and post-hatch. There's a $10k cap on liabilities - can pls someone or @santigs clarify if this cap applies only to "activities" previous to hatching the DAO? Or if that was the best starting legal figure implemented to "protect" the first trusted seed member of the CS. 2. Q's on the need for further "legal design" in terms of how this DAO will operate. I've seen 2 different models put forward (MorlockDAO vs DASH). Given the different implications of both structures - has there been more "high-level" thinking or conversations around the "ethos" the TEC want to embed itself within? This connected with being qualified as a "trust" or "endowment" therefore avoiding or minimising some fiscal implications (IRS or EU-related?) 3. Q's on the Licensing Agreements/IP/IT between the devs and the "DAO governance" - this connects with the post-hatch phase and being more or less "decentralised" and T&C's evolving in that way.](about:blank#)

_25-Mar-22 10:48 AM_:

Here's an interesting read for TEs. Though we all more or less know the difference between 'utility' and 'security' tokens, the SEC stance, and of the Howey test, here's 38 factors (and sub-items) the SEC looks at when assessing a token (therefore useful for designing tokens, token economies and reviewing existing ones). Some of these points also shed light onto why, besides explicit benefits, certain structures of disclosure, marcomms, usage, issuance, governance, control, and support (e.g. MVPs, secondary markets, DAOs, LP tokens for rewards, etc..) might be necessary to be SEC compliant and being able to fully operate on centralized platforms in regulated markets like the US.

Urban Acupuncture Fund 25-May-22 02:48 PM

Hello! brand new here and excited about any legal resources that might be available. We founded our token in Feb. in order to fund small urban interventions that make a difference in cities around the world. We see this as a small step along the path of changing the way the real estate business works and our cities are built. The coin was created quickly and has run into a number of issues recently. We are now fully committed to our core idea, confident that we will gain traction and ready to move to a grown up version of this project. We are just beginning that process and deciding how to establish a DAO or Foundation... and I heard about your swiss association that could be the right approach. We would love to know more. Thanks!

I am personally (legally/tokenomics) advising alongside many others on ReFi/land-based projects similar to yours. Not only legal considerations are important (and always in need to suit specific contexts/jurisdictions/communities) but also a cross-view on cultural/regeneration aspects. Coincidentally, tomorrow at 13ET/19CET there will be an overview/presentation of a 1acre land-based garden in Colorado that is **implementing an exit to community regen model with the Limited Cooperative Association structure (Colorado)** in the works: [https://discord.gg/xXEdnnJxez?event=983784865998700574](https://discord.gg/xXEdnnJxez?event=983784865998700574) (edited)

The Limited Cooperative Association Act has been enacted in 8 states of USA (not only Colorado and Washington).

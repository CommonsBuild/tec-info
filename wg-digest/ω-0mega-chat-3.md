... and sadly this is a typical problem of any organization... in Siemens we used to say "If Siemens knew what Siemens knows", our research depts were 15k of brilliant people, and all they had to go by is performance talks and assessment centers... and it did not fix the issue ever. I believe appreciating the value of each participant in a transdisciplinary field like TE requires new techniques, and a new mindset... I hope you find a way to collaborate on this. Please call on me with whatever I can support, facilitation for conceptualization, the past experience with particiaptory action research etc. The topic is very important - and it requires first for the three most impressive newcomers - because you hit the nail on the head & have the appropriate skills, intuition, and/or experience - the three of you to collaborate. Call on the resources of TEC to help you make it happen - preferably without politics and in innovative ways that are radically inclusive. I'm cheering for you, and am on call whatever you need!

In my view the most impressive innovative way that can solve part of the issue this is the TE Consilience - Living Library proposal, it is a "different knowledge hub" that is designed for encounters between newbies and OGs (edited)

!praise @Mert Ozd @Letty @nic @stef @Mount Manu @durgadas @SatoriD for being long-time and new contributors to the TE Consilience Library idea, for starting to prototype, and looking for soulful and artful ways to enable serendipitous encounters around TE knowledge through a living library experience.

@nic @SatoriD I tried to weave in your inputs, let's see how it goes - it seems we will use this session to gather feedback; so maybe instead of going full play, you might just share your insights - we can definitely have the first 10 mins on "how is everyone feeling?" "What can we help each other with?"

and I think @Satori if you start the infinite play baloon on that topic, people will play - I'll try and keep time

Everyone please have a look at the topics/questions on the agenda before hand, Nic's gathering feedback on the past two sessions

looking forward!

@durgadas thinking about not having time to write about your methodologies, I wonder if @Andrea could help with that?

It both develops complexity tolerance and also solves the immediate problem

@bear100 Take a look at those and see what you think. It'd be cool to know how you perceive what's contained in those links. Once you're done, maybe we can discuss next steps then so you don't continue being overwhelmed. If at any point, something doesn't make sense in those links, you can ask us. There is a lot of info there so I don't expect you to read *all* of it. Just let me know when you feel ready to dive deeper into the initiative, or maybe dive deeper into what 0mega is about.

@Jeanne I'm in Kernel too! I'm interested in exploring the idea of having a self stock; how does one replenish their energy stock? How can we do more of that which energises us? How can we ensure our needs our met? Can we design systems that reward/energise people in other ways than financially?

not much right...

but then look at how the artist, researcher, performing arts, dancer, into ethics and philosophy

nails it!

there is just no bachelor, career, team, predertermined development plan and performance talks could ever provide for this.

only the transdisciplinary art of "token engineering"... this just puts me in awe, and I'm so grateful <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f64f.png" width=20 height=20>

"peer-to-peer" vs "master-slave" (github only last year or so remain "master" branch into "main" ... but you'll find it still everywhere [https://info.bannerengineering.com/cs/groups/public/documents/literature/tt_masterslave.pdf)](https://info.bannerengineering.com/cs/groups/public/documents/literature/tt_masterslave.pdf))

"regenerative" vs "extractive"

"energy consumption" (kWh) vs "energy efficiency" based market models <-- the reason for skewed incentives, why we cannot steer to better options as long as we have to play the game of a certain worldview: sell more kWh because this is how the business prices it

(btw. this can be also played with WoWW game /cc @nic for the ReFi bootcamp)

however, there is no reasonable change if we "fight the system" - we need to integrate all worldviews and come up with a model that computes through all of them <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f642.png" width=20 height=20>

This is a description directly from the book: Conscience is an essential human attribute. Nevertheless, in the construction of formal models of the subject it is customarily left outside the framework of theoretical analysis. The Algebra of Conscience, whose first edition appeared in 1982, was the first specialized work modeling the phenomenon of conscience. **The method used in this book made it possible to connect moral experience with decision-making procedures on the level of mathematical models.** The application of such models allows us to propose the hypothesis of two fundamentally different ethical systems determining the normative patterns of human behavior in situations of conflict. Under the first ethical system the subject's self-esteem is raised if the subject seeks to resolve the conflict; in the second it is raised by seeking to dramatize the conflict. (edited)

" It is shown that in this case the probabilities of choice of the alternatives may change chaotically. From this it follows that one cannot predict which alternative will be chosen or even the probabilities with which they will be chosen. "

‚Äú*Now we can just accept that we don't know, and treat everything as imperfect knowledge, but that would be a severe limitation. In particular with regards to computational systems: in the case of programmable logic, we have the unique opportunity, that we can exploit the potential, meaning the extent to which something is not yet determined as design space, and we can devise tools that not only prospect the future, but truly shape, engineer and create the future on the simple basis that it is possible. It doesn't even have to be probable, just possible. We can approximate it step by step, but we can also develop technologies and tools which make outcomes legally and mathematically predictable. Then we can project a future, and navigate on that projection, and adjust, correct, improve and adapt before it even happened yet. This is the bright future i see for our domain, and the part I am truly most excited and happy about*‚Äù

I've been thinking about newcomers to 0mega and also starting the crowdsourced curation for the library... What if as a first version we had something like this: - where any media type can be added to the knowledge source - we can customise the fields, eg which petals does it relate to? why do you think this is a good addition? - anyone can comment (to share that they found it valuable, or to even have discussions which in themselves may be valuable) - anyone can signal that they found it valuable for TE by adding their name in one of the fields called Signal People who may not have much time, but still want to learn can start learning from the knowledge added, and signal that they received value from specific sources. This would be great for newcomers too. Maybe we can have newcomers share their projects somewhere in notion, and instead of adding their name to the signal field, they can add the specific project that gained value from it From this version, the ones signalled as most valuable can start getting added to the TE Consilience Library itself. It's just an idea for the first version, but at least we can start filling the library, and getting feedback from people and actually start crowd-sourced curation. (edited)

0mega-Collective Curation for TE Consilience Library

Share it with your transdisciplinary TE curation collective should be min 2 people each person should have experienced TE rabbit hole tunnel system from the lense of more than 1 discipline When curating for the living library a value-add is your personal annotation: How did this particular refer...
it's the weekend - and in 0mega we are both long time TEs as well as newcomers

we have experienced there is no "one newcomer persona"

some people come in and hit the ground running

some people come in and enjoy listening in

let's see how our melting pot 0mega will experience the collective curation

as you add your profile and curations, feel free to also make comments on the template! What works what doesn't

I also shared this template with zargham, trent, Shermin, and Simon - until now only Zargham and Trent came back (pretty enthusiastic) and I haven't yet heard something from Shermin and Simon. The reasons maybe many, maybe curation is not for everyone, maybe sharing isn't for everyone, maybe life happens, and it's the least thing they can now add to their plates etc.

let's get rolling, who looks forward to bond asynchronously this weekend over a collective 0mega curation for the living library?

we can see how it is to add videos, quotes etc.

once we have a range of items, and people have presented them in this paper-prototypes, i.e. gdocs --> we then have data on "How's the process? Too long? makes fun? did curators leave comments on each others items? maybe they cross-annotated? "hey I read this when ...." or leave a note on another curation "haha this song! OMG- it was in my first ETHxyz event...remember vitalik dancing?!" (edited)

then we know which blocks to use how in a Notion template, so this should be good input for what you're proposing @nic (edited)

_11-Mar-22 05:18 AM_:

again a word of caution on investing too much effort into notion... how many people can edit in notion? if we wanted to keep the free tier: we'd have to make random people admin, which means, some one could just join and delete the whole thing, randomly or by accident. if we pay it's 8‚Ç¨ per user. So if this gets traction we will move very fast from Notion prototype to its own web app (edited)

and in the meantime, it will be loving-caring librarians moving data from templates to notion... or we might keep the gdocs collections as a way to reduce workload if the notion is not going to be kept

so we have 1-2 collections (or as many as we can port to Notion prototype without thinking this is wasted effort) in Notion Prototype

and any incoming curations using these templates as a collection

traction means: people actively asking for template, share in their curation collective, return with ideas how to improve, and wonderful set of transdisciplinary curations

it also means we love and more people love caring for the library making it beautiful, interactive, living connection between knowledge synthesizers in TE

h/t to @Jeanne for this inspiration, too:

I don't know what is "enough traction" that would justify the effort to develop a web app for it >> happy to host a valueflows session when we have enough engagement, e.g. 2-3 collective curations submitted

True, let's keep the Notion as an MVP but play a bit with some curations in it. With this idea of multimedia and annotations, also cross-references as it seems how we think in Omega. It'll be more fun to explore and curate content. Let's migrate after, if it makes sense, to a more customized app (like a massive TE wiki deployed in Netlify as @stef suggested). The obvious advantage of the Library over a classic wiki would be the quality of curations/curators, the specifity and broadness of knowledge and its application to the TE inner game.

yes but only aware of like 25% of the wikipedia discussions... My general impression is that it was hugely innovative/beneficial in its early beginnings and now fell trapped of its blindspots in the original system design.

That should be the beauty of the CLibrary mechanisms: open enough, permissionless enough and incentive-driven enough to be a living commons. I still struggle a bit with the practical implementation with the no gatekeepers policy, especially taking into account how our notion and miro work had to take place till now. I guess we've been decentralized enough in this effort as to claim to be "legitimate" sufficient to third eyes.

Linked data

In computing, linked data (often capitalized as Linked Data) is structured data which is interlinked with other data so it becomes more useful through semantic queries. It builds upon standard Web technologies such as HTTP, RDF and URIs, but rather than using them to serve web pages only for human readers, it extends them to share information in...

I'm also part of a group which is looking a this from a meta-ontology perspective, while the abstractions are breathtaking, the "practical" steps or community embodiment is "freeze and fly".

First, thanks for the DUMP. It got me thinking so I wanted to share what it stirred up in my mind. In my opinion, No, Leadership is not always disrespectful of consent. I think that to answer the question as yes one would have to assume that all individuals desire complete agency in all instances. I don‚Äôt believe this is the case. Life is hard and varied, so different people exercise their agency in different ways at different times depending on their individual bandwidth at that time. I hate to say this because I feel like I am stating the obvious, but many of us don‚Äôt want to be in control all the time. Leadership exercised by a narcissist will probably always manifest in violation of the implicit trust of the ‚Äòclient‚Äô in a ‚Äòserver-client‚Äô relationship because narcists are narcists. Leadership exercised by someone who lacks vision or is inexperienced will likely result in situations similar to a narcissist. The difference being that the narcissist leader is immoral whereas the inexperienced leader is unethical

@MargaritaDave @nic Are you guys aware of an existing management theory pointing towards "beautiful constraints"? I used to present/implement it in corporate/startup settings with a high level of uncertainty or very risk-innovative prone. It plays beautifully with the enabling constraints we want to see in the onboarding/library/sessions initiatives and working style. It goes like this: (edited)

i woke up thinking about libraries: libraries often hold community outreach events designed to be all inclusive. readings sure, but arts and crafts, speeches, small musical gatherings, talent contests. - all to stir the community stew and unlock any stagnate cultural value that has cropped up unnoticed. they are often fundraising events. the smell of the books ... i wonder what the modern version of that will be. - bold ambitions and significant constraint

"Tit for Tat: Tit for Tat is a strategy by which you cooperate when the others cooperate and punish when others defect. I think it is a good heuristic on a personal level. You, a priori, show your intention to be cooperative and positive-sum, and only when the other player shows a different intention you punish or defect. Whenever they show their willingness to cooperate again, you switch back to cooperation as well. Depending on the situation you might also apply Tit Tit for Tat since others might have defected because of difficult circumstances or because they aren‚Äôt used to this kind of thinking and it might be important to show a willingness for cooperation for a healthy long-term relationship."

"...Lore is something you witness, and attempt to shape as it emerges, if it emerges, not something you design and execute. You cannot, for instance, set out to write an origin myth. At least not one that will work as lore (though it may work as part of a grift). You can only recognize and institutionalize one. A very early sign of this mindset was visible even 15 years ago, when early internet marketers made fun of traditional marketers for thinking that they could ‚Äúmake viral videos.‚Äù True virality, it is now obvious in hindsight, is an emergent feature of lore, not an engineered feature of marketing..."

I'm starting to think 0mega is about finding the limits of token engineering, and what lies beyond...

this always reminds me of "dimension lifting"

"...when even your boss is potentially an app streaming tasks and bounties at you rather than a person, when your world of work does not exist in the reality distortion field of a Steve Jobs, but in the inanimate reality distortion field of a stack of cobbled together SaaS tools, you end up thinking very differently about traditional questions of supervision, authority, tasking, and coordination...." <<-- hints to the areas "Vision" and "Action Plan"; "leadership" etc. definitely keen on seeing more resear on these new streams the author dubs "lorecraft"

Yes, this goes in line with the "north star" concept we introduced for Omega recently... I agree Omega operates in the interrelation of ethics + lore, with an inherent purpose of making the unvisible visible and providing for new lexicon and symbols (inner and outer). This "map of the territory" seems to me much more adequate for the WGs and the whole TEC to explore their missions + actions. Also in relation to the onboarding assessments currently being done as to get rid of the KPI and traditional focus matrix I saw referenced in some conversations/docs (which sincerely made me cringe).

look forward to today! how should we do the Living Library Experience session? @durgadas is taking a break - maybe we can start there....

Again we talk about Regenerative Finance - but we need regeneration of all the flows down/up to the source

this self stock is really important @nic I think you found a gem there...

just had a quick "synch" (i.e. we are random walking in the same idea space) on "social capital" with @mZ - there's a factuality to it, i.e. undeniable social capital exists, however also an attitude towards it: are we helping each other to build social capital, i.e. seeing it as an abundant resource, especially 100x when a diverse group with special gifts can help each other to gain/cultivate it - or are we seeing it as a scarce resource, i.e. "OMG there's only so much social capital to go around, I better put my stakes in and fight" ... and then there's also the environment, that can make you (who might have a natural stance or even an abundant view on it - or a scarce view) think: hey social capital is in abundance/scarce around here

you might argue about a theory of sound money, i.e. it should be deflationary or breath with the system

but obviously "social capital" is a pure mind construct...


money/tokens is too, but mostly people feel there are theories that are god given so they don't question the minting/distribution mechanisms

and the strange loop takes us back: autonomy


the concept of radical agility is also important:

now it will be easier for newcomers to get info about 0mega



!praise @Mount Manu for letting me test the energising initiatives idea on him. Very helpful in improving it so that it can be a better experience when I do 1-1 with members of 0mega (edited)


!praise @bear100 for sharing with us his perception of the library, based on what's been shared so far. Very helpful in understanding what is exciting about our initiatives and what info can be received from what's been shared (edited)

Some naming/branding: - Omega as the Universal compass - Polaris, North Star, Osa Major. - A new energy-based cartography for future-looking initiatives: Copernicus and Kepler revisited. - Initiatives (library, degrees, ethics, books) as islands/stars/constellations woven by research or black matter. - Self-sovereign agency to decide which rocket to hop on: informed by curated processes and a 360 map to experientially explore possibilities (territories/islands/constellations) around ‚úì The luring of the Kosmocentric Worldview

I would assume that a reference is published in one domain (x) but makes strong connections to other domains (y)


sometimes (rarely if in academia) a reference is published in interdisciplinary space than it could be (x & y) & (x' & y') etc

right?

or what did you have in mind?

and we will have a bunch of non-academic references, videos etc. so there maybe it's more about how the curator sees it

"Both discovery and ideation can be performed in both ways. "Expert" will likely only catch "complicated" data, while "Distributed" is more likely to elicit "complex" aspects. If the purpose is radical innovation, the second is more likely to produce interesting results. Which one to adopt, however, depends on context and expectations.

Hello everyone, I know its Saturday but I really wanted to share this idea with you guys. So I kept doing my research about libraries and I was thinking about ideas on how to make use of the metaverse for the creation of the library in some way. This led me into finding this incredible and unique project that everyone should know about‚Ä¶

[https://youtu.be/EBI7-pL52GY](https://youtu.be/EBI7-pL52GY)

[https://uncensoredlibrary.com/en](https://uncensoredlibrary.com/en)

Instantly I related with it and thought it could be a really really interesting, fun and innovative alternative for the creation of the library. Then when I saw it was built on Minecraft (an already stablished and known ‚Äúmetaverse‚Äù if you think about it) it came to my mind another project that is transforming Minecraft into a play-to-earn game‚Ä¶

so then I thought that maybe it would be possible to take these two projects together and use them for what Omega is wanting to do, maybe we could be talking about the first online living library represented as a real life library (with all the good stuff that comes with it) in the metaverse that could have an innovative and sustainable revenue model as well.

Yeah, maybe it‚Äôs a little too ambitious for a first stage haha. I really liked the website as well. Another reference to have. Pretty simple, intuitive, and looks nice. For what I understand, once you buy a plot of land you can build anything you want on it with no extra cost. The plot I shared is the cheapest and it‚Äôs around 260.

[Hello everyone, I know its Saturday but I really wanted to share this idea with you guys. So I kept doing my research about libraries and I was thinking about ideas on how to make use of the metaverse for the creation of the library in some way. This led me into finding this incredible and unique project that everyone should know about‚Ä¶](about:blank#)

[https://youtu.be/EBI7-pL52GY](https://youtu.be/EBI7-pL52GY)

[https://uncensoredlibrary.com/en](https://uncensoredlibrary.com/en)

Instantly I related with it and thought it could be a really really interesting, fun and innovative alternative for the creation of the library. Then when I saw it was built on Minecraft (an already stablished and known ‚Äúmetaverse‚Äù if you think about it) it came to my mind another project that is transforming Minecraft into a play-to-earn game‚Ä¶

[https://www.critterz.xyz/](https://www.critterz.xyz/)

[https://critterzdocs.notion.site/Critterz-Documentation-ab014615fbec4e4ca2349ebfdbdadaf1](https://www.notion.so/Critterz-Documentation-ab014615fbec4e4ca2349ebfdbdadaf1)

so then I thought that maybe it would be possible to take these two projects together and use them for what Omega is wanting to do, maybe we could be talking about the first online living library represented as a real life library (with all the good stuff that comes with it) in the metaverse that could have an innovative and sustainable revenue model as well. I just think it could bring so so many super interesting possibilities to this project. Check the links out and let me know what you guys think or if Ive just completely lost my mind haha <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f61d.png" width=20 height=20>

_21-Mar-22 10:13 AM_:

I been thinking of the NFT redux as the symbol of omega and even later the unfolding of the NFT redux project, as both symbolizing and then actually being your personal compass, that guides your thru your crypto-flower journey

_21-Mar-22 10:21 AM_:
@nic here are some of my first thought on "cards" NFT redux. A guide to TEC and the web 3 universe. I want to have a structure that helps build foundation for a simple yet important skill set that we should be slightly <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f343.png" width=20 height=20>

of change towards.

i think first is the power of 3 steps to work out simple mechanics of the cards

but over all its 5 step rhythm, for deep belly breathing

this ties into one question I want to focus on, and I think I can bring the most to the table, in this area. How do we build up our capacity for complexity?

By creating our individual and collective capacity to have a calm center

relaxation is a skill set, and its all relative too, what works best in the moment is not always the same thing, or even the same tech for each person

we can have general guides and tech for groups, but always slightly guide, everyone, to also dig deeper

and find what works best for them

and thats when they actually add to collective pull of skills and tech

for what we all learn collectively and individually on this strange weird wild journey we are on...

*Creative Participation of the Whole ‚Äì a North Star concept, Omega*

later I want to work up towards this

I been thinking about the DNA strains

are schools of thought

and personally i am working on my "school of thought" on how disembodied poetics as a key to being about to "read" people, in these disembodied spaces, in which we interact.

the imaginarium made this one about 3 years ago

now I realizing what it actually means... i think...

but i still like this lil video, and its core to what can help, create these bucket full of books, that can be the buckets for the crypto flower petals

so that I can start editing together

media, art so that we can get the felt experience of what i think is moving all of us to bring everything we got to this table (edited)

working towards language on how to talk about this wholeness of vision

NFT Redux, gives us space to create in a common way. So that novel networked relationships can be understood, so that we can begin to cultivate the complexity of the eco-system flow.

This is real growth over time. Invest in people, minds, handwork and poetics.

the emerging patterns within the ecology of the mind become the compass to chart pattern, information, and ideas that happen to be embodied in network systems and the eco-system flows.

"‚ÄúThe next Buddha will be a Sangha.‚Äù In Buddhism, sangha is one of ‚Äúthe three jewels,‚Äù and is translated as community. So what does it mean for the next Buddha to be a sangha? It means that we need not just our teachers or our practice, but a community around us in order to protect and nourish our practice. "

_22-Mar-22 05:09 AM_:

how do we enable curators to share their most treasured insights? #1 user experience, without the value stock of "insightful library content", I doubt we'll be able to create meaningful navigation of other follow on experiences

I still struggle with this. the current template was sufficient to get people excited, but I think it lacks "features" that make curating for the library meaningful for the curator

imagine: the content we've been mostly looking forward to comes from people who are in the trenches dealing with tons of tokens - so more tokens is not incentive enough

they are also constantly asked for some of their knowledge, so asking for more of their time and knowledge is just another energy drain - so what value will the curation provide for the curators? I don't know

hmmm... maybe a vision what will happen with the content, what follow-on value and useful experiences it will create? chicken-and-egg great! we have a nice network flywheel if we crack this one

there's always the "resonsibility" incentive <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f642.png" width=20 height=20>

@stef I guess this is what you mean with "seed curations page needs other images and content?" or do you mean something else?

also feel free to use the more artistic visualization with some suitable notion of labes" instead of this jpg kind of breaks the sire

so that the energy flows are visible in the work streams (and praise only picks up public channels!)

if not possible, you can create a new public thread

ah damn jus see that it doesn't pick up in any sub thread.... but that's ok, coming back here to praise the energy flows is a nice way to hint at value creation happening in the various work streams

it needs a twitter account for gitcoin

I think this whole web3 marketing machinery is excruitiatingly not sustainable, not regenerative, it fractures instead of focusing efforts wdyt? this really really bugs me


markets need "market criers" ... markets are inferior information processing engines, hence markets fail all the time. marketing is a corollary of that

we haven't yet build a better global information processing engine

the misbhehavior of markets [https://users.math.yale.edu/users/mandelbrot/web_pdfs/getabstract.pdf](https://users.math.yale.edu/users/mandelbrot/web_pdfs/getabstract.pdf)


have an idea for learning groups... what do you think about creating such detailed abstracts collectively as a value-add learners can create?

every action whould have a value-add to individual and value-add to the commons / the collective (Invisible Economy principle) - if not some party would need to be subsidizing the other (energy drain, from individual, or from commons)

if this equation holds every action is a gift

the "need to learn" can become a contribution depending on the "design of the action space" (edited)

maybe this makes the difference between abundance and scarcity?

I feel you! Our paradox here: designing and researching on energy-based emerging value flows while constrained by previous web3 ecosystem prescriptions (enabling constraint?).

_22-Mar-22 07:21 AM_:

Btw, for those completing the diagrams async, this is the way I‚Äôve set up the call: 1- starting off asking if they are interested in signing up to figma. 2- Then move on by going through the notices on the right side of the instructions and have them voting (clicking plus sign) to acknowledge each of the statements. The statements inform them that they can always take breaks and to let me know if they need one, that this info is public, what the info will be used for, and asking that they don‚Äôt change others‚Äô cards. 3- Then going through instruction 1, then having them follow it. 4-Then going through instruction 2, then having them follow it. 5-Then I give a tour of the widgets (todo list, markdown notes, chat) 6- I ask if they feel ready to do it on their own. If so I let them know I will send further instructions to help them out 7- I send the further instructions/homework:


**Homework** - Feel free to read through the linked documentation around the initiatives. Connect as many of your green post it notes as you feel is right, to the initiatives. You don't have to connect all of them üòÑ , just the ones that suit you. Don't forget to add a rating out of 1-10 how much it will energise you. Maybe if it doesn't energise you that much, it would be good to not connect yourself to many initiatives. Maybe you want to only work on one initiative for the moment. It's all up to you. If you have questions, reach out in the #omega channel and ask questions there. - Read through Instruction #3 so that you know how to maintain the initiatives that you are willing to be a part of. - Think about these questions: ‚û°Ô∏è How can the library earn TEC tokens? ‚û°Ô∏è How can the library mint TEC tokens? (right now only money mints TEC) ‚û°Ô∏è How can TEC tokens represent value of the public goods (not the common pool)? ‚û°Ô∏è How are we going to distribute the funds we received for the library? Can you come up with ideas for them? On wednesday 23rd, we are going to be creating stock and flow diagrams (read about them here https://thesystemsthinker.com/step-by-step-stocks-and-flows-improving-the-rigor-of-your-thinking/#:~:text=Stock%20and%20flow%20diagrams%20distinguish,flows%2C%20while%20CLDs%20do%20not.&text=In%20contrast%2C%20a%20stock%20and,a%20negative%20number%20of%20births) and designing systems on how the above questions may be made possible. - Lastly, please reflect if you felt tired after doing the session with me. Let me know if it did drain you, so that I know if it's better to come up with other ways of onboarding people üòÑ


@solsista @Letty ^

@Andrea has offered to guide future newcomers to 0mega through this call if they desire to be guided. So I will be showing her how to do it so that after this week she can continue guiding when we have newcomers. I will improve the instructions on the map and also write a wiki for the areas to mention when guiding like the above message. The map itself will be part of the onboarding pinned message. (edited)

@stef transcendental in LA that was too good, as I set here in the city of angels(LA) trying to beat the sun to start this new day, open up the power of the flower, satori is transcendental in LA...

i always find it funny and interesting, when anyone in art refers to Los Angeles

this city of lost angels

_22-Mar-22 08:44 AM_:

I think we have to move towards this, for me its about how deep our networks are we at this time, is we need the "right" people, we need to bring all we got to the table, what flowers and songs you got in your pocket?

cuz IRL hit me hard recently, I had to let go, and trust the collective and you know what you guys here and @Eclipsingbinary blew me away
 <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f49e.png" width=20 height=20>

this is what I feel and this is what I know. that given a sense of purpose and sense of empowerment, most curious minds will do all the task needed, because they see and feel it. I believe when I first learned to howl, I was speaking for 0mega group and Imaginarium. those words were ours, and so doesn't matter if satori here or there, the satori lives in us, each one of us (edited)


NFT REdux is about yoU, us and we

Axis Mundi, is a symbol representing the center of the world where the heaven (sky) connects with the earth.

for me Infinite Imaginarium is the center of galaxy

i can feel it even if no ONE can see it

i see it in all these words that are being use, it makes me feel whole

I realized alot of things recently

That I know who I am and I know how I want to be and I know what I want to do with my life

and the way I go about doing it

is what really matters

i can feel it and I can see it

it gets self reflected back to me

in this fractal pattern, of inner truths towards outer paths

_22-Mar-22 08:53 AM_:

learning groups of 3-5, with bucket full of books protocols and Infinite Imaginarium functionalities. should be the best way to explore, create, research.

I want to push this idea to my next step learning group I want to create, its about environment in which this crypto-flower will grow (edited)

Disembodied poetics and Ecology of the Mind

this is how to read web 3 projects, to understand ecology of the mind

so that our universe doesn't fall apart in one day

NFT Redux, perhaps first time, is to symbolize the first emerges of learning/creating groups

and you gift them too the 'homie'

some one curious and you want to tell them everything

but your like awww just go to the learning group its all there (edited)

from learning/creating groups that should emerge should deal with the petals of the flower

but for me its very important that we have the physics of our universe

What I am saying, we should not settle for nothing less then, doing this thing the way WE want to do it. and for those curious enough, to find their way here

we should error on what emerges from the collective minds shares

for my part, everything I do here, is creative commons

I want to develop this source code, narrative codex

in which is like the TAO of commons

principles of disembodied poetics of hyperspace

and essences of the ecology of mind

this should narratively give us something like physics of our universe (edited)

right now, what I can do of most usefulness to the whole

is to develop the way we think, talk and begin to create

welcome to disembodied poetics of hyperspace

and to push this even further

we need to develop Art Residencies

but this should always emerge from the process

this is how michelangelo created the sistine chapel

but for us its not about any one "host"

commons and groups

and I think this goes without saying at this point I can take up the role of shaman

Shamans as the first shapers of myth

and there are already interesting ways to do this creatively

using the joystreamDAO to <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f32c.png" width=20 height=20>

Ô∏è the way we do it

they need work done too

win win

p2p deep networking

co-creativity at every scale

its already unfolding

And since I do collective creative editing with my Imaginarium crew I can break down, how I go about doing it. and share all my work will all my friends

and they you have pieces to put together and planet this seed

or share the seed

maybe first a learning/creating group residencies

5 souls ready to jump straight into the abyss

that would be the most interesting way to move forward

but we the first to create with omega space

its begins with our mind flow fractal set <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f32c.png" width=20 height=20>

*It was clear Muggzy was entering a chrysalis stage‚Ä¶ and when she emerged she would no longer be a camper van art studio, she would be a butterfly ‚Äì I mean a FOODTRUCK!*

NFT Redux should give anyone working with it, the tools, knowledge and network to use NFT meaningfully to produce their own "dream" version of NFT Redux

once you got the <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f9ed.png" width=20 height=20>

then its time to chart a course and research explore and create

this is too good

scribbles might be the way to go with the living log

curry knows the mechanics of that

but with curry now our learning/creating group, will have a living log, everytime we sync

and that should be something baked in

creative notes

several different types, so that more and more people can add to the creative curry

this is now a interesting puzzle to see what kind of different sets we can make

those will be the mandala of minds

how many different kinds of useful sets we can have

i think are like chemistry for the groups

i think it just how the pieces fit and can remix into some interesting

fluid roles and dynamic structures

like each learning/creating group will over time have different version of the mandala of minds shares nft

I am thinking after you are apart of a "collective" learning/creating group

you can fractally break off from them

and that you crack the mandala minds share

and how you have the start for your new group

personal compass, you, then group us and we is the commons

ebb and flow

The entire crypto-flower ecosystems right in the palm of your hands

the logo can't understand blake, but can you create?

what flowers and song you hold deep inside your pockets?

development of the NFT cryptoflower "card" game

to help guide anyone curious on there omega journey

yes, the site is just a start to have an idea of how to visualise and navigate all the abundance of information, whilst having a sense of relevance to the petals of the cryptoeconomic flower. the [https://consilib90210-39f36.stackbit.app/seed-curations/](https://consilib90210-39f36.stackbit.app/seed-curations/) page has images that we re added previously, and haven't been made by contributors to the library. A wild idea for what would make this library different, (why arweave hosts the background files), would be to have a permaweb base of existing and new, curated material in relation to the 8 petals of the flower (and its corresponding fractal resonances) a library that can make the otherwise lost flux of daily updates, become useful for another millennia of humans..

_22-Mar-22 04:57 PM_:

disembodied poetics is something like the soil, in which we plant the crypto-flower and the ecology of the mind, is like the air, wind, sunrays and rain and environment in which the seed will spring out into reach for the sun

for me this is foundational of how we think, talk and begin to create in this commons way

i'll have a write up about NFT redux, as this narrative codex. I had a good rant with @nic and I read from my notebook, I have to type it out

@stef the way I been looking at it is poetics is like the mycelial underground networks that support health root structure for the flower

![https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/810180622634844202/955935105103327282/IMG_2641.jpg](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/810180622634844202/955935105103327282/IMG_2641.jpg)


and ecology of minds is the sun rays, winds other

its the hyper context that those transdisciplinary/interdisciplinary that will emerge (edited)

from the petals

so practically the first learning/creating group, is the prototype in which we work out the mechanics of how we work and create in these groups of 5

i want to bring in the collective intelligence work that jim

the minds share mandala actually hows the structure for co-creative working groups

there are some principles it would be interesting to work out

which I can break out and layout for the group tomorrow

@stef hope this helps you, the lil color drawing was when I unplug and i was color with my lil cousins and then I was like oooOOooo ok maybe view it like this

so we can view poetics as the dank underground, its the unity of thought, that is our personal compass, that moves us thru this crypto-flower space

what brings you here in this moment to omega

this is deep rooted network connections

so @stef its your personal collective art space, that brought you here

and this working out some of this shared collective omega thinking

should help nurture and feed your personal passion and dreams

so as we work on how to think and create together

these different things that emerge we should be asking ourselves, what does this mean to me personally. how can this help me get to were I want and need to be

or something like where do I fit in this new space

something like how I want poetics to work in this NFT puzzle game of crypto-flower self discovery (edited)

and how we can create a culture that trusts the personal compass, and create space for us to collect knowledge collectively. So many pathways the TE library can go...so exciting

Really great insights about the self and movement as expression. I am excited to learn more from the resources he will be sharing and to help each other with coding problems haha

yeah, I think we start thinking of inviting some inline project, thoughts and people working and creating. how about we call it something like entangled co-creativity, the scientific insight into the interrelatedness of all systems of life on earth.

The emerging patterns within the ecology of the mind. Bateson argued that ecology of mind is an ecology of pattern, information and ideas that happen to be embodied in things - material forms.

A mind can include nonliving elements as well as multiple organisms, may function for breif as well as extended periods, is not necesssarily defined by a boundary such as an envelope of skin, and consciuosness, if present at all, is always only partial.

it's the play of complimentary opposites - just leaving the body and be all up in mindspace happily every after, has a bit of an escapist feel to it (actually still spending most of my time there myself). It is "similar" to building a rocket ops from scratch to terraform another planet - just in the opposite direction of immaterialistic worldview... we need both to "steer" spaceship earth - or rather get in tune with its nondual navigation system

"as a vast multiplicity of *apparently* differentiated subjects and objects, thus initiating a vast dance of self-exploration ... now this act of creation is called a play or game, in the sense that this activity is fundamentally a free and joyous act of self-expression, done entirely for its own sake... The word "play" is simply used to indicate an activity that has no purpose outside itself, as well as pointing toward the notions htat joy and love underly and motivate the whole process... Rather than "play" one could have used the word "art" to express this understanding - for that word has connotations of creativity and beauty that are cntral to their vision of reality...though "art" implies "artifice" while play - or perhaps "artful play" better expresses the organic, spontaneous, dynamic quality with which the universe unflods and, as well, alludes to the childlike wonder experienced by those who see it as it realy is..."

all pumped up for my 0mega self-onboarding session... I did some deep sensing, and it's surprising, yet not surprising, why I'm here. As soon as something is figured out I need to go where the open questions are; so it feels like TE is being figured out, even web3 can (and will) have its playbook... these will show the gears and teach ppl about the machinery under the hood, all the while telling, don't get too used to it: automatic is just around the corner, then you won't need to shift gears manually (like these proposal, marketing, voting processes we have are literally manual, and mechanic); and then it will say, btw don't get too used to your co-pilot cause you know these cars we're token engineering we'll have GPS, and it will continue to say, and that steering wheel, and you my dear pilot (leader or whatever the community wants to call you) will be more or less, no, more of redundant human avatar cuz this thing is self-driving, hell, that's the whole reason a bunch of token engineers got together to engineer this car, figure out how to hand out driver's licences, and build the road, whilst we were still MVPing the car itself. (edited)


so I'm looking for the wisdom of web3, because all this engineering is futile if we end up with masses of passengers who were told to take a back seat... like that's not that type of car we'll have when we're done engineering - and because of that we cannot engineer it with the same mindset we used to engineer mechanical cars


so we need to space out into mindspace and come back to manifest wisdom of web3 now-ish

this is gonna be a whole lot of fun

I need to prove your theory, so that I prove my novel theory right and I want to say for the record, all of this exchange of energy is more than mutual. as i was telling @nic I first howled, here in this room, because of sol sista and the beating hearts of the builders and coders of TEC. That something just got set in place, deep inside me, and I let it out, and I just knew, this is how all those greats, that I would read, have felt this. This is how it really goes...

now all I can think about it all the next beauty moves we can all start to make together

the unfolding of this process, is where we really each start to become, that this sunflower sutra, is with in you, yoU are the anxis mundi, were you sit right now, with in your mind, this is the center of the galaxy, its our time, to take our seats, and the table of life, and be humble, for we walk on sacred ground, this is the deep networks, these are the mechanics of the dreamtime...

I feel like for inside TEC we need to balance the "spiritual" (that may just be my misguided assumption, maybe it's time for another TE community survey) - but definitely see that 0mega or whatever is happening here is this "philosophy generating" principle

I loved the archipelago @nic ! it's wonderful medium to self-reflect, and helped me focus where I can best contribute

added few questions on onboarding, as in how to best "household" with the energies of the TE ecosystem, if we know 0mega has a special angle at "TE related discussions" and how to guide people to the various learning experiences in the TE commons ( we have a section for this in the Living lib as well)

another insight: I'd love if entire worflows blossomed entirely from what is available - instead of "what is needed" ; but then if ppl don't "advertise what is needed" then we'll lack action plan - however, if we only focus on what is needed, i.e. we think we lack, we don't progress either... and looking back this is not how we rolled - and that brought all the artful play in here!

e.g. we said we need visualizations, and #1 instinct was to follow "brand guidelines" and "hire designers", instead we ventured into creating accompanying art - for the sole reason that @stef happened to be around in that WG session, which now provides for the potential of a multimedia visual living library experience

so I guess what I'm trying to formulate is that, yes let's put up "what is needed" - but also everyone feel invited to get creative, and tap into your resource-fulness, as well as the courage to say: I'm not a marketing expert, but this is what I would like to try for xyz

still I agree we need "guidelines" - but maybe more like a "principle" or capturing the essense, soul of an initiative - and any "how" that is aligned with that essence is worth experimenting with, even if it seems "unconventional"

Ecology/Mandala of the mind and the self-actualization in this ecology

curiosity and meaning, is what this all boils down too

NFTs, library, learning/creating groups

its about using this curiosity to forge our meaning

along the way well have all these beautiful wisdoms

to add to this puzzle NFT card game of self-discovery of your crypto-flower

i think 40% is like theory, 40% practice using knowledge to build and the last 20% will be try to invite everyone or anyone to begin the journey of self-discovery of your sunflower sutra

I am also thinking it might be more like 45%, 45% and 10% poetics of self

I am gonna make a bot dance!
 <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f49e.png" width=20 height=20>

I also want to teach bots about William S Boroughs, for reason i yet to figure out...

sacred can also be thought of the wholeness of the system

Sacredness: Revered due to association with wholeness

my general philosophy is I believe in nothing

spiritual words are just poetry for me

but if we diamond cut those words

well something else really comes into focus

wholeness, commons, Tao logic

always always seems to leak out

when ever i diamond cut all these silly silly words (edited)

thats why I love bateson, there is no mysticism really with him, its about wholeness and the patterns which connect

is only at first seems other

but its because our thinker, thinks that way perhaps

mind is embodied in all the thing we do where we realize it or not

P.S. lil on going task, we should all start to think about what working group session that are meaningful to us, like make something like top 3 list, and it can be lil more wide open, to eth Denver talks or Daoist stuff.

because i am gonna start working on making some video edits

and I think I can do it in a way

that leaves it open to anyone curious

can pick and begin to learn to do it as well

i can do it in a way, that we create pieces and collages, that really anyone with some attention and time, can make there own hypercontextualize videos about this whole strange 0mega journey

we also will have to think about the best way to have a shared resource of ceative commons art/media that all of TEC can pull from

thats whats I believe is invert with how things go

they put marketing and promoting

before the actually hardwork, of doing your own homework and forging your own words, thoughts, and felt experience

those later, once they become a "thing" with in the collective, emerging nft card puzzle game... (edited)

become those memes, those images, symbols, the way we say things, *I don't know it just how its done* (edited)

it goes without saying

because we are all on the same page

or at least working on the same book

but also can be just like music playlist, later some eternity remixes that come up, and nft puzzle game, learn when you need a calm space, to center yourself. and other things perhaps we use to turn down the noise

and I couldn't quite explain, but reading this it is a consistent point we're making: Vision, Mission ... it reminds me of this saying: be careful where you want to go you might end up there. The assumption behing Vision, Mission is "Today we know well how the future looks, and we all see the same" - Mission? We will make an attempt to replace it by "Practice" (next week: workflows)

[https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2020/03/04/vision-mission-and-purpose-the-difference/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2020/03/04/vision-mission-and-purpose-the-difference/)

Council Post: Vision, Mission And Purpose: The Difference

Vision is the picture. Mission is the road map to get there. Purpose is the feeling that everyone, from the CEO to the janitor, has when you accomplish what you set out to do.

![https://imageio.forbes.com/blogs-images/forbescoachescouncil/files/2020/03/a-25.jpg?format=jpg&width=1200&fit=bounds](https://imageio.forbes.com/blogs-images/forbescoachescouncil/files/2020/03/a-25.jpg?format=jpg&width=1200&fit=bounds)

So today we listened in on Purpose of the Library (and listened in how much each of us resonate with that purpose)

We defined Values that our collaboration on the Library will *create*

This isn't science, more like a song, a tune we're coming up with we can quickly remember, and also easily and energetically impart on new participants, contributors

If we keep these sessions short and sweet and actionable, it can be part of the Practice, e.g. we ask again after some time, after the prototype, after new people with different energies joined etc

If these sessions are also helpful for self-reflection they can become energizing themselves

so instead of a Mission statements that is static, we have ourselves an alive Practice that fulfills the same function adaptively

And like this article talks about new concepts and new terminology that is important to know.

recently to focus and calm down the noise, I been coloring mandala

something like psychotherapeutic praxis

I go over to my grandma's house she 93 with dementia, but with coloring and with those few moments of just being coloring, her language and words are more sharp and memories and thought float out her mouth better.

I also been wanting to bring Wabi-Sabi as a concept, into the mix

Wabi-sabi is the quintessential Japanese aesthetic. It is beauty of things imperfect, impermanent, and incomplete. It is a beauty of things modest and humble. It is a beauty of things unintentional...


there term we used in imaginarium, well that was beautifully imperfect, for those organic moments when things sync over a cosmic giggle.

_23-Mar-22 09:19 PM_:

"Admittedly, the beauty of wabi-sabi is not to everyone's liking. But I believe it is in everyone's interest to prevent wabi-sabi from disappearing altogether. Diversity of the cultural ecology is a desirable state of affairs, especially in opposition to the accelerating trend toward the uniform digitalization of all sensory experience, wherein an electronic "reader" stands between experience and observation, and all manifestation is encoded identically." -*Wabi-Sabi, for Artisits, Desingers, Poets & Philosophers.*

the meaningfulness of NFT REdux used in this way, is that we begin to map out how we stay heart sync and balance within ourselves. what helps us have grace under pressure. what is that we do or playlist, we put on, that always gets us in that zone, or helps us bring down the noise...

_23-Mar-22 10:21 PM_:

*Beauty can be coaxed of ugliness. Wabi-sabi is ambivalent about separating beauty from non-beauty or ugliness. The beauty of wabi-sabi is, in one respect, the condition of coming to terms with what you consider ugly. Wabi-sabi suggests that beauty is a dynamic event that occurs between you and something else. Beauty can spontaneously occur at any moment given the proper circumstances, context, or point of view. Beauty is thus an altered state of consciousness, an extraordinary moment of poetry and grace...*

We will curate these into the lib


And to the questions as whether we are trying to create a chaordic organization... if there is will, I would only go as far to say, it is experimenting


my experience working in these environments for quite some time now, is the acceptance that organizations are chaordic - if you find th sweet spot, no actuall it is a sweet thread, then value creation and community cohesion happens in flow - no matter how different it may look like. You know it is happening when you feel drawn to it, you feel resilient, resourceful - it is very different than project management, a project has a beginning and an end

@SatoriD @stef @bear100 would be great to have you synthesize how NFT Redux cards (or derivations) can be used in learning/synthesizing knowledge ... after last night I thought, we are not novel in our "curation template" ... what we could do is collect (from self) and others who already received the template hints what is holding back. One thing we'll here is "no time" <-- so could these cards be dropped and get curation one by one? with a symbol, topic, anything that could trigger something? any best practice? e.g. I started a list now with ppl asking about topics, and will curate from those etc



I also found this very interesting for lawyers in TE [https://purpose-economy.org/content/uploads/purpose-guidebook-for-lawyers10022021.pdf](https://purpose-economy.org/content/uploads/purpose-guidebook-for-lawyers10022021.pdf)

not only that it is about restructuring governance and finances in corporations for steward ownership, i.e. New Common Sense for Commons; and it's aim to "Maximize Purpose", i.e. all profit flows back to creating more value towards the purpose of the organization


But also because of this:

it is very similar to the purpose of valueflow diagrams, and doing that system modeling collectively with the participants/community

it's just as you said @Andrea (did I use a wrong name yesterday?) - the alignment happens naturally, if the community gets a chance to DIY <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f642.png" width=20 height=20>

this isn't something that should be done by lawyers or token engineers for that matter

the initial players (people) come up with the initial rules (purpose - principles) and start playing, since it's infinite play, you don't play to win, you play to keep playing


it may be harder to see this for other things... but for knowledge? we know it is infinite play, and all human knowledge is provisional

the living library hence can be an easier entry point for developing this new common sense for the commons

with that I wanted to remind us all - we have not yet defined all values (ask why five times: ) :

![https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/810180622634844202/956459164085932092/unknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/810180622634844202/956459164085932092/unknown.png)

- why is transdisciplinarity valuable (to me, to this library, ...)?

(why did the text turn red?)

- why is connections valuable (to me, to this library, ...)?

when you come up with a phrase, ask again, why is that valuable, and again, and again <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f642.png" width=20 height=20>

Please share here in the text or with post its in figma jam board

I think this is why playing with "curation template" is needed, meaning these are questions, say for @Mert Ozd has all this curiosity and passion for possible curation options. it would be great to heard what this person thinks about that, or this. well what is that or this, I think we ask oursevles, what curation is needed for ourselves, who are minds that we look to in times, we want to push ourselves over into new space, or when we need to calm down the noise.

personally I am on the NFT being used meaningful track

that becomes some sticky note and later on monday we can have some fun, on how useful and valuable that insight really is

@stef this is great about your dayjob, I was thinking of mines in terms of the Toltec oracle, but same basic principles, but we can porotype the "puzzle" card game, off what your already doing, and its all about modifying it for our use case

i think first steps, is terms, concepts, ideas, and schools of thoughts?

this is in one sense, curry and myself, working out our felt pressure under this pyramid scheme

so nowadays i only really go to curry when I have some solid to work on, both our time is valuable to each other, to not waste each other "time"

so I go to him, kind of thinking of a spell

and i'm all, ok its like a vaportest, but not. Ok so think of pyramid right

you know I am always taking about the pyramid of fire

did I ever tell you about the dream I had about Ah Xoc Kin?

and I think curry mapped out my transcends

in his visual poetics

its only over time can you really see

what this all really means

there's one of blowing down and the other trying to put into a bottle

that's basically imaginarium creative style sync


let's just hope we can catch lightening in a bottle

no ONE really knows how to do it, but when it happens (edited)

_24-Mar-22 04:34 AM_:

A Human Genome is complex system. Genes are strings of DNA along the chromosome. Genes which code for proteins. In complex systems terms, you could think of genes as simple components that interact with other genes in a decentralized way. And the way that they interact is through genetic regulatory networks. They control one another's expression, where expression means translation into proteins.

Here is one small genetic regulatory network that's been mapped out by researchers: [http://rulai.cshl.org/TRED/GRN/NFKB.htm](http://rulai.cshl.org/TRED/GRN/NFKB.htm)

_24-Mar-22 04:46 AM_:

playing is not thinkin, playing is doing, its creating in action of the imagination, how do we talk about this with people we want to curate, what might be the most meaningful way to present this idea that we really want


we play both roles, and we view it from outside and inside

its best just to just do it in imaginarium sync

i feel am times, I have to walk in circles, with in your box

its ok, because I use that time so I can hop and skip over and see

map, flesh out, creative notes, infinite play, map out more of the infinite game


its the hexagons under the wild growth

imaginarium is the wild growth

I need to blow up all the balloons and play with them

cuz we got more than enough pieces here

and i'll show you how to really play

it takes time

yes - and the "art" of valueflow diagrams is not to create the full map - just the distill the highest leverage points (which also change over time!)


you know who have an "actionable plan" if you have a minimal sustainable validated value flow; meaning all mech in place such that the value stocks do not shrink over time, or start to grow at all (promise, I'll document, and annotate our process, and with feedback it will become clear we are co-creating a business/financial/gov model without excel files and divisions for each function)

i'm working on a figma creative work flow chart

i'll get the basic up before i unplug tomorrow, and I'll have a basic disembodied poetics codex in place, so we got a source code, to play off of

codex will be probably typed out on monday, something like that

but anyone curious just go thru this channel, and do your own version of creative notes, make notes of those things that sing too you, or ponder what are our values

![https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/810180622634844202/956572206199091260/xlarge.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/810180622634844202/956572206199091260/xlarge.png)

I think bring in cylinder space, can be useful in which its meant to hold all those lil gems of sticky notes

and then flower is the group symbol for now

i think we need to create our own honeycomb shape

I have an insight gifted to me just now, I want to share - because that is so suitable to our situation: [WHAT] - [HOW] - [WHO] if we have "all the time" we can let all 3 emerge... and we're using these multiple media we are extending time intervals


when we synch and have to limit to 60-90mins then we fix one or two to let the third dimension continue emerging


and we can and should not always fix the same dimension

and I would love to still have sessions that are free all emergent

perfect yes! async 1-2-4 and we meet next wednesday

another hack: these fundamental topics that come up here - obviously also are my day job; so even if I can't 2 -4 with you, I do it in the other organizations - it also brings in "outside" perspective (as I don't feel the difference, we're all in the same boat... space ship earth)

(btw. was just in a session that did 1-2-4-all in zoom, it wasn't the same 2 people in the 4, but 4 different people... it really is about "cross-pollinating" perspectives to gain broader understanding... of "differences" but also, especially of "commonalities"

I'm reading this book and it talks about how listening by holding space for others thoughts instead of just waiting for them to be done speaking so you can speak, can fundamentally nourish the other person. The brain tends to emphasise defensive structures, until you provide for it a healthier adaptive scenario or response. So creating more experiences of what secure attachment feels like heals the self and it feels more like a healthy exchange. Even imagining such healthy experiences can help...which means even experiencing unhealthy experiences digitally can hurt. But the brain does want to heal so if we continuously create experiences of healthy interactions maybe we can design the library to foster healthy relationships between itself and its users

wabi-sabi, wabi refers to, the inward, the subjective, a philosophical construct, spatial events. sabi refers material objects, art and literature, the outward, the objective, an aesthetic ideal, temporal events.

this is holding the beautifully imperfect, so that the "ugly, nasty bits" that perhaps block, can be dealt with, and this is when beauty shines, this is when the grace of the pressure start to emerge from the intention of holding this space, this wabi-sabi, its always relative and in relationship of the here and now...looks for personal idiosyncratic solutions, One of a kind/variable, there is no progress, only present-oriented, Organic organization of form(soft, vague shapes and edges)...


part of this for me personally is to unplug, start to get in new habits of moving away from the internet, computer, screens, and dance around in the here and now of IRL


my issue of balance I want to be in this hyperspace, dancing all these things I know and see

but with IRL hitting me, to told me to don't get head of yourself, you are gonna get out of <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/2696.png" width=20 height=20>

and then every your are saying are just silly words

but this inner journey is the water that I can really swim in

so i'll dip and dive in

and bring all the gems that I have inside

this is ... there's this notion of how "idea space" is accessible to all, etheric (don't recall the name/concept) ... when I experience things like this, i "know", that is "true". There's no other plausible way how any two strangers across the globe, with different upbringing, culture, gender, education, language, ....... anything you might call identity, see the same patterns




meeting spaces like these are something like "truth sensors"

and the follow on responsibility is how to make that accessible, experienceable for more people: e.g. I can try and translate it into "where I come from" , that is with all the different networks quite some reach... and each one of us doing that will result int dissemination of the new common sense

(not trying to formulate one vision, one goal, and a charismatic personality to rally *the world* ... that's not enabling change, that is having world domination fantasies)

slowly starting to "know" what 'be the change you want to see in the world' means

monday, he'll be there with my imaginarium style creative sync. yes yes let's play around with this!

i'm gonna do some inner hunting but I am gonna bring and share all my gems

working on something like a disembodied poetics codex

‚ÄúThe first poets were gods. Poetry began with the bicameral mind. The god-side of our ancient mentality, at least in a certain period of history, usually or perhaps always spoke in verse. This means that most men at one time, throughout the day, were hearing poetry (of a sort) composed and spoken within their own minds.‚Äù ‚Äï Julian Jaynes, The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind

it's a bit of a learning curve but it's so fun to create your own little worlds - could do it for hours

I'd be in for blender bender if you're down!


protoype for Blender Bender September. what we do is pick out tutorials we want to learn. i pick one, you pick one - we can make it a group event for anyone wanting to learn to Blend. We take a week to slowly play with a tutorial and really learn the ins and outs of that scene. compare the different perspectives on the scene at the end of the week. maybe contests if there's motivation and interest and in the end we're all blender masters

@SatoriD I have to head out in 4 mins, but just a heads up, if your ideas or initiative will involve other working groups outside of 0mega and will affect everyone, it's worth considering bringing them into the conversation. You could also start off with creating within 0mega, solving the problem here, and getting feedback, iterating and

*then*

collaborating with other working groups to expand it past more than 0mega. I'm certain you can totally figure out your own way of going about things too <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f973.png" width=20 height=20>

@SatoriD Maybe keep jamming with EcplisingBinary and Curry, on how you can onboard them, and from there the cards idea will gain more structure

_29-Mar-22 07:27 AM_:

this is interesting, so my point with that thought, is this, yes I am gonna start off with Omega, and I do help onboard my friends, in my way, but this is more like WE can do this, and really its organic flow is that whether we realize it or not, it does affect everyone(half what I believe we are really doing here, is realizing what interconnectedness actually means in praxis), and i think my point to myself and maybe everyone else, is well I am doing this, but really WE should do something like this. so of course I don't feel comfortable, moving into space other than in here(omega), to be frank. my idea is simple, but if taken seriously it affects everyone, here and actually already has changed things already in the imaginarium.

one thing I think is fair to say, is we are all feeling our way into how we fit in together, and being more open with this, is in essences 33% of the cards

the whole idea is NFT puzzle game to self-discovery of the crypto-flower

roughly 33% is TEC Theory, 33% is TEC praxis and 33% is the wyrd

I feel like my experts at least relative to this task at hand is in the wyrd

hence disembodied poetics

i did update NFT Redux, with latest realizations

both should be considered living shared docs, yes I seeded this idea, but really for it to be living, its has to be US (edited)

disemobodied poetics is living, thanks @Letty for dancing with it, for anyone check out the comments, that lil back and forth is what the NFT cards, really are. there a way to help gamify, the work we are already doing. I been realizing this for myself, on how my brain works and how I work best. So for me I see all these balloons and all this raw clay, and I have this raw clay, I brought over all the good stuff I been holding inside, ready to get to real work and real play. But I can do this and I can do that, but for commons We need to "jive" so we can figure out how WE can do things.

we is happening, my point in which I like to reinforce is that we need to be more mindful, of what is emerging in the here and now.

with all that said, things went wyrd in the best way. I was talking to my homie about this last night. it always work out this way. Ok once I told this friend, about I did a rain dance once, to try to get out of a baseball game, I was like 11. but I told him after the game it did rain, so you can do something like that and it never really works out how you think it will, but in a funny way it still really happens. (edited)

so one time he wanted me to do a rain dance, and I told him, ok i'll do it, but just remember this, for it to really work, then you have to take it serious, ok because I can take it serious and I will, but if you don't then it wouldn't really matter. and so I do a rain dance, and we have some wyrd fun with it, and we go on our day, doesn't rain, but we smoke weed, go to the beach and it was chill, he drops me off at my house, I am walk to my yard, it begins to rain, I turn around, walk back and told him, see I told you fucker, it never works out how you THINK it will... (edited)

maybe one point is WE can make RAIN (edited)

but just one lil bee shaman, doing is lil moondance, is good and powerful

but for commons

which is useful way to think about things. I been often thinking of the physics of this universe, poetics is unity of thought, but gives us something like environment of space, is there wind that play with

along with @Letty commentThis is also expressed in the "Future Systems" roles by Houston/Smitsman: 1. Wholeness Coder 2. Future Creative 3. Evolutionary Catalyst 4. Pattern Weaver 5. New Paradigm Storyteller

I been reading Learning from Leonardo by Fritjof Capra: *Understanding a phenomenon, for him, meant connecting it with other phenomena, for him, meant connecting it with other phenomena through a similarity of patterns. He usually worked on several projects in parallel, and when his understanding advanced in one area he would revise his ideas in related areas accordingly.*

that over time the creative group is the renaissance mind

that with the NFT self-discovery puzzle game, can mind map out things, so that we can retrieve understanding evolves over time

I think its fun right now to think of the roles are perhaps buckets for certain type of insight and wisdom

so the shaman bucket, what would be in there

for me I used some disembodied quotes from In the Valley of Novelty talk by Terence McKenna

*What can you do, what do you do, if you can do anything? I mean, that‚Äôs really the question at the end of history: once you have overcome all limitation, what is the human agenda?* (edited)

for me personally some version of this I like to often ask myself, in context of whatever I am doing

Is this really what I want to do. Is this my path with heart.

another fun one I like to say to myself at times is. Is this what I really want to do, or is this what I THINK I want to do.

1. Wholeness Coder - Coder/Builder 2. Future Creative - Artist 3. Evolutionary Catalyst - Shaman 4. Pattern Weaver - System Thinker 5. New Paradigm Storyteller - Student/Beginner's Mind (storyteller) I agree with @SatoriD suggestion: What if we use these 5 roles now and forward within Omega workground work? We could "label"ourselves and explore connections with the puzzle game + DEB in this way.

_29-Mar-22 12:43 PM_:

If we apply the "future roles" categories we'll have 5 kind of players to play the game-version of the value flows course in online cohorts. It kind of shares the same narrative so we could adopt the same"board game" for future participants. 2 for 1 - the library has its own flows (with curators lining up) and the course adapts our NFT puzzle discovery research later on. It's also the onboarding route for future students + a session scheduler. (edited)


I'm also aware of one other ecosystem within the ReFi space that would LOVE to have this game made.

Discovery phase is nearly done... Onboarding will require buckets + basic boardgame ("missions/initiatives", "quests/narratives" and "badges"/deliverables) Scaffolding: testing our MVP (library set up + NFT dynamics/improvements and DEB workings) Endgame: none - this is an infinite game

_29-Mar-22 08:01 PM_:
I feel like parts of myself fit in each of those roles. As to the Phase I being finished, we are so so so close!! We are still missing this: "In the beginning of our library we will have ‚Äòseed curations‚Äô from subject matter experts that will collect 5 to 10 articles" My curation group has 3 curations so far. Unsure if anyone else have started curating... @Jeanne @UniPuff üúêüêô @SatoriD @stef @bear100 @Jolly LaMa You have all mentioned really cool things in conversation before and I'm certain you have cool resources to share to the library. Please take a look at the curation template that @solsista created and see if making a copy and filling it in with your curations is something that may energise you! I understand that the way we're doing things, its organic, purposely slow and with lots of care, but also playful. But I think that it would be really helpful for contributors if the progress that has been made in these initiatives are recorded. For example, for each initiative answering questions such as: - What is it it's purpose? - What value does it bring? - What has been done so far? - Who is leading it? - How are things done? Another thing that would be helpful is creating some sort of 0mega dictionary. This way there is some place that a new person can refer to when they don't know what you are talking about. For example, what exactly does "Disembodied Poetics Codex" mean? It's easy to lose people when they feel overwhelmed and alienated by language that is hard for them to understand. I think the updates on each emerging initiative and the emerging 0mega dictionary can be in one document that a new person may refer to. Perhaps this will make them feel empowered to participate - after having learned new things right away. Let's care about those who want to play with us and try to energise them upon joining




I can see the 0mega dictionary becoming the cards which they learn from too....

@nic I been thinking about the curate thing, I think these video edits, can be conceptualized a lil bit later, by the group. and I'll see what curry toss my direction. and Do something NFT Redux and see about getting some DADA people talkin about there concept of exit to community, I think it really ties into what I mean by NFT Redux

and also with some people from teamhuman, we are working on mandala narrative, to work with mind share mandalas, that one its wild one, but i think in time, I can get teamhuman discord, imaginarium and Omega working group, to have 3 transdisciplinary between 3 creative groups

I multiple things cooking, in a hypercontextual way

also curry when the time is gonna, gonna share with me what his doing with Minds and there official NFT launch thing

that would be cool, to get bill thoughts, curry drawings and thoughts, and then fill it out with some imaginarium collective magick (edited)

I'm bring this up tomorrow, but want to toss idea of doing some collective on minds and getting something set up on joystream, I am gonna sync up with some imaginarium people laying some ground work over there. i'll get the run down tonight. and we can game plan tomorrow

this sample of a fully demo of mind mapping Quantum Psychology by Robert Anton Wilson


so we are gonna just to a collective mind mapping, so I get the learn how to do it myself, and with him i'll work out mind mapping the archetype of the shaman

then we can work out the others, after i get one down, and perhaps we can work on the others together

but lot of moving parts, to say the least

just want to everyone to know some interesting connections and relationship I am cultivating

I am thinking also, with in sync with emerging blenderbenderprerender

to have really cool visuals to go with omega rotary mind mappin

very fresh emerging deep network connections

[1. Wholeness Coder - Coder/Builder 2. Future Creative - Artist 3. Evolutionary Catalyst - Shaman 4. Pattern Weaver - System Thinker 5. New Paradigm Storyteller - Student/Beginner's Mind (storyteller) I agree with @SatoriD suggestion: What if we use these 5 roles now and forward within Omega workground work? We could "label"ourselves and explore connections with the puzzle game + DEB in this way. I'd also suggest that Phase 1 of the proposal is completed and we distribute funds as per the proposal @Mert Ozd and start building new poetics/valueflows for the NFT game + DEB (connection, transdisciplinarity and novelty - phase 2 and 3). @solsista @nic @stef thoughts on this?

doing what? I don't understand, I'm sorry. We just got the first initiative funded and people are contributing, it's great news what @stef just shared, our consilience flower is on a show!

What about the people who already put their cards and energies onto the board, and who have been contributing for the past months?

supporting their needs will also help close the knowledge gap in the administrative things to be done area, where @Mert Ozd has been doing a lot

we have a lot to document

that too will help clarify many things that are already happening by people contributing

the next big todo is update the working group 0mega proposal and get funds --> that will have to clarify the remaining questions

it's just work to get the answers

let's get together @Mert Ozd and @nic and write that

I just wanted to try gather knowledge for them so that *they* wouldnt have to spend energy just trying to even get a gist of what we are aboit thats all...so I think I will just go with directing people to other people

it's super late here, don't want to go into detail too much, but just to show it's a process that people can follow, it would be cool to do it together with those who want to contribute to the library (which I'm only "on-call")

but I can make time if you want to organize a call with all participants

or we use next week and put it on the agenda (sorry it slipped today, but we needed to make space imv for the creative workflow option, which will speak to others... I was actually looking forward to wander a bit in that maze)

these are the answers of people who contribute to the TE Consilience Library, what it's purpose is, not some "leader's vision"

(I cannot participate in the library, because the 2nd problem that you identify correctly: The TE Ethics initiative is stalling, which is important, and needs a huge redesign, so I would love to have some space for that working alongside the working group proposal)

so that was my first exposure to "really can't be something taught," and I heard that from @mZ when I was (actually very much like @nic) all inquisitive about "tell me how to do it!" ... so there is that aspect about systematizing and system modeling... you need the inquisitive mind to take you all the way to the edge, and then you need freedom and creativity to fly

hello everyone... finally starting to understand what is the misunderstanding: it was clear to me that we would spend today doing the play ground - as part of the workflow upgrade we're working on (we .. . the most complexity tolerant who can handle systematizing in this environment). (see exchange from here)

my mistake/mishap was not updating the agenda

it is important that we have this creative space - it is not for everyone, nor does it need to be; but it trains our translation capacities between different modes of work

to some who did not follow the discussions and those who wanted to hear more on point 1 it seemed like off track, but

but we actually did cover almost all points

and how hard it is

coming from engineering heavy side of things and the corporate world that is excellent in operational excellence, currently driving us hyperefficiently towards extinction, please hear me out: play is more important than checking off agenda items.

it took me about 8-12 months of hard work to learn to play: [https://medium.com/freeelio-studios/le-grand-jeu-met-token-engineering-and-it-was-love-at-first-sight-e7a85c6d9444](https://medium.com/freeelio-studios/le-grand-jeu-met-token-engineering-and-it-was-love-at-first-sight-e7a85c6d9444)

there are other parts of the working group that are super clear, process oriented, - but also need integration into "workflow"

I'm just a bit sad, this cost us many hours, agenda's as points of sync are important - it would have solved the issue, if someone raised it in the call before it became an issue

please be as open and direct

‚ÄúI like how the game puts the cryptoeconomics design space, especially the political economy dimension on the table, which many in this space rather intentionally or unintentionally try to compress out to make things simpler. That becomes a failure mode [in token networks]. It is then an issue of education, of making the concepts experiential. When we define these concepts in an abstract way, they become intangible. But people need to learn them, and they are not going to learn them by reading papers‚Äù ‚Äî Zargham, the night before he became a game master.

Play is also different from game - which will be unsettling to Token Engineers (it was for me, after I got game, *I died* when I understood "Infinite Play" )

as the difference is the following:

![https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/810180622634844202/958894749476065361/unknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/810180622634844202/958894749476065361/unknown.png)

play is not mechanistic

there is a place beyond token engineering, yet it becomes a possibility through TE, cryptoeconomics, web3 and all other interconnected developments of our time

"the valley beyond " <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f642.png" width=20 height=20>

"A game may very well allow for elements of play, but play will never be a game. Play only serves play and entails freedom to evolve its own nature. In play, one is not able to presuppose direction and outcome"

yeah faces will help with onboarding, I think I'll try to be on camera more. I can be very animated when talking, and I think to jeanne point, its important for perhaps syncs, to have some embodiment, so when we get disembodied by decentralized web of tik tic time. then this helps with the "spooky" dancing at a distance, adding @Jeanne "I could propose this kind of play even when being distant but proposing actions with objects to explore together..." and we got something cookin

so to reinforce this, imaginarium style, I have space, today (PST its 5:00) let's go with 9 - 11 am this morning, to have a open invite to practice and creative sync, for anyone we wants to toss some creative balloons and getting moving into some play space, so that we can dance this spooky dance at a distant

I also want to tie in something @Jolly LaMa and myself was tossing around, this can be seen as we are feeling our way to a buddy system, so we can figure out those that we feel comfortable to play with, and even in which ways...

what we discovered yesterday is that there are different [How] and Principles in place.

This is an opportunity for us the experience together the TE Ethical Principle on "Hosting multiple Worldviews"

I have worked out a Practice Session for it in the TE Ethics Initiatives


You'll find all info in the TE Ethics Initiative island in figma, it is called "World of Worldviews Game"


I would offer to host a practice session where we put the topic of "regenerative workflow" into the middle and play tha game to understand and appreciate the different principles

It can be our go-to for docs and onboarding link to newcomers.

I kept the original seeds curations. Though I don't see anymore the blocs/gallery as the MVP for further curations. What is emerging is that **CONSILIENCE** is our overarching theme, and we're consiliencing around with initiatives: library, ethics, groundwork. This understanding may help give structure to inform our proposals wording and all initiatives on process.

Anneloes Smitsman believes that love is a strong solution to the problems of our world in crises. She encourages us to ask three questions about being a vector of love: 1) What do I reach from? What is my point of origin? 2) How far can I reach inside and outside myself? 3) What am I reaching for? Anneloes Smitsman is the Founder and CEO of EAR...

@bear100 I started collecting a few links that people found insightsful, incl. Chaordic Organizations, but also two essential pieces from systems thinking, Donella Meadows, and "Into The Heart of Systems Change". I hope it is useful to get you started: Please feel free to add links shared that can help other newcomers to make sense what we do differently and why

this can be also the start for an 0mega Curation for the Library

of course everyone is invited to curate sources they found useful and that define their perspective why they want to contribute to 0mega

I would suggest, that anyone wanting to understand the full power of Imaginarium, will need to play around with minds, and then they can start to learn the imaginarium way, of dancing at a spooky distance.

Imaginarium along with Mindsgaming, has this "organic" network, of real people. meaning we basically know everyone who interactions with our networks, there our community.

so we all have groups, matrix chats, and ways we toss <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f388.png" width=20 height=20>

here's another thing that will be fun to Infinite Loop in "Idea: Actually viable on-chain reputation score via locked tokens" [https://github.com/Joystream/joystream/issues/3535](https://github.com/Joystream/joystream/issues/3535)

for our emerging creative styles

I am gonna set up Imaginarium channel over on joystream, and I have my buddy mindsgaming getting hip to the scene, so that Omega and friends can piggyback on our imaginarium style working the bazaar hustle

"*cadCAD is a **differential games** based simulation software package for research, validation, and Computer Aided Design of economic systems. An economic system is treated as a state based model and defined through a set of endogenous and exogenous state variables which are updated through mechanisms and environmental processes, respectively. Behavioral models, which may be deterministic or stochastic, provide the evolution of the system within the action space of the mechanisms. Mathematical formulations of these economic games treat agent utility as derived from state rather than direct from action, creating a rich dynamic modeling framework.*" (edited)

Computer-simulations can show you where your assumptions about the smart contract constructs will break, it will only spare you from the obvious (that might not be obvious to all, so it has merit)

what one then needs is **intuition**

super human level

or

a way to **co-create with collective wisdom**


*wisdom*

not random data

not collective unconscious

not collective confusion

is this an easy task? do we know how to go about it?

no. and NO.

shall we give up?

If you got lost in the Interstellar dimensions... will you go back find a leader that tells you what to do? gives you safety?

(sure this leader will be different and will not be corrupted by power, let's pray... or, you know, since it can actually be fun and liberating let's try something else)

will you put effort in exercising self-leadership?




(btw. Interstellar is a great movie about the human drive that in the face of extinction even we do not give up, still the move also shows humans have both selfless and selfish source that feeds that drive and if you still haven't read Play of Pattern: "*begin thinking in terms of **complementary opposites**. Rather than using dualities like 'decentralization good, centralization bad'; or 'DeFi is innovative, fiat is boring', this style of thinking recognizes that there is no good without evil; no attraction without repulsion, no North with South, no up without down. We could describe this as "quantum thought" - being able to contemplate both 0 and 1 simultaneously, and the spectrum of probability between. This is not about just both/and thinking, or seeing "both sides" of a debate. It's **seeing both sides and the entire spectrum of possible states between without grasping after certainty**.* " )

So yes, for this type of integration we need to get comfortable with metaphysics ... remember we have human systems, and anything that is built making assumption based on closed systems, thermodynamics is not going to make for a useful model

So we have looked into models coming from Graves, Geber, Wilber.... and this one I particularly liked because it moves to "transcending paradigms" .... to "A-perspectival".. not by diregarding all perspectives, neither by saying, well there are just as many truths as perspectives (discrete thought).. but actually more like the play of pattern thought saying... once we made this huge effort to integrate the many perspectives, once we get comfortable experiencing the whole spectrum... we get to A-perspectival vision

in machine learning we call these "ground truth" ... it's the common ground we stand on

and humans have a capacity to sense that individually, nonconceptually, as a whole

the moment I use word (which is concept) I differentiate and that sense is lost

I would like to add a few minutes of silence into our agenda next week: no camera, no sound. We are just invited to be right where we are in that moment. The "exercise" will be to sense connection.

this is the only "how to" I trust can onboard you onto finding your intution - anything else is "my receipe of what I think you should think" (and asking for steps is "tell me what to think" <-- this is an antipattern for onboarding to 0mega) (edited)

ah yes here's the link to A-perspectival integration [https://integralreviewofbooks.wordpress.com/category/process-model-of-integral-theory/](https://integralreviewofbooks.wordpress.com/category/process-model-of-integral-theory/)

and it is not only in your mind (especially when monkey mind is too active, likely you'll have difficulties finding it... the analytical mind is actually a useful tool, that is not what I mean with monkey mind... you can tell the difference by asking "are these thoughts useful?" "how do they behave?" ...and interestingly the unhelpful and misbehaving thoughts actually diasppear when you become more aware; and you can train analytical or critical thinking which is an important skill for token engineering and decision making in general)

ok this is a bit shocking, didn't think Steve Jobs would come up looking for "heart compass intuition"

but yeah this somehow somes it up... if you are already educated into one or more paradigms, driven by external rewards so much so that your intrinsic motivation (the inner voice) is drowned - this piece of "advice" is indeed shocking. (edited)

but it's cool

you are in 0mega

Becoming (philosophy)

In philosophy, becoming is the possibility of change in a thing that has being, that exists. In the philosophical study of ontology, the concept of becoming originated in ancient Greece with the philosopher Heraclitus of Ephesus, who in the sixth century BC, said that nothing in this world is constant except change and becoming (i.e., everything...

Model- and Data-driven Optimization with #2 for TE cadCAD study group with from @solsista
"‚ÄúA changing quantity has two aspects: One is its value at a particular time, the other is its rate of change at that particular time. If you study those two aspects, you'll create calculus."

(that's why when you animate the valueflow diagrams in your head, you get a good feel whether you have a sustainable "business" model, i.e. token model, or whether you need to get out of the building/machine/your head and find more space for co-creation

for the library for example: it's all in our heads, as long as no curator, or no visitor interacts with it

and it's good start up advice not to fall for "build it and they will come"

what we currently do is test the hypothesis of "value of novelty" by artists providing that value over time

that's not in our heads, that's currently happening

_01-Apr-22 06:19 AM_:

and if you ask and listen to @SatoriD and @stef you understand what motivates them - yes of course there's extrinsic motivation: "my art on display for this really hot field in web3" and "a stake in the library's network wealth", and "hey I can use this to create funding options for me - and the library and peers contributing to it" (this feels particularly good - better than UBI, it's peerUBI, it is I am because we are... and not because some institution provides UBI magically). But also if you really listen you hear the intrinsic motivation, it's more like a tune, I cannot put in words

so for co-creation, we need to get actual people from other "agents cloud", namely, curators, guides, visitors/learners, as well as builders into TE Consilience initiative <-- with the goal of onboarding is to help them co-create, like the artists do @nic - is this helpful for how to onboard who onto TE Consilience Library initiative?

remember it's all calculus 0 value multiplied by 1000 users = 0; a ton of value (and times and resources of contributors invested + the 15k we got from TEC) multiplied by 0 = 0.

*"A changing quantity has two aspects: One is its value at a particular time, the other is its **rate of change** at that particular time."* that rate is determined by incentives in humans. the direction is determined by purpose. (edited)

"same methods" needed a clarification: it is sufficient to have a clear communication about the methods used, if they aren't necessarily the same

I still grapple with Competition, I don't like to "coopetition" either.. I think it's a worldviews thing again. but what it says without that word/concept is correct, could even lead to Conflict UNLESS WE ARE AWARE OF OUR HUMANITY, and being a "vector of love"

Certainly following the 0mega Principle "Unity in Diversity" will make clear it cannot be Competition nor Conflict, but our collective potential, and only we each one of us is resposible for the next action we take

@solsista I am working on this novel way to help us navigate in this complexity. when my friend should me, he told me I was the first one to instantly "grok" its meaningfulness, well its very useful to understanding 1,3,5 in which 1 is that quantum position, center of the cyclone in satorid sense making, but 3 is your transdisciplinary poles and then 5 because the group/co-creativity of meaningful novelty and bond of interconnection (edited)


but I also realizing along with @Jolly LaMa the on ramp, the buddy system, is key, as with you individually is true scaling up, meaning, 3= buddy and buddy system on boarding, then working out the 5

like dance steps

we need to learn, try, and then practice play

and then maybe dance together

or use mind mandala meaningfully

but I am very excited the way we(satorid+teamhuman) are moving

so I got this write up, that I need to type out but its called **Decoding Poetics in Disembodied Space**

and its about me unlocking the word, "wyrd" via the handwords in beowulf

*Who is the "Shaper" and what is being shaped? Who adopted this collective set?*


poetics of Beowulf, literally spore print in which two opposing belief system are **frozen** together. Christian transcribers defaced with dogma; others contend that its pagan pronouncements are relics of a time its culture outgrew- the poetics equivalent of the human appendix. While fascinating from the standpoint of cultural anthropology, but ultimately lacking a unified theme? Decoding the "striking pattern of hand-words" helps to unlock wyrd so that **WE** can establish that synthesis.


sound->words->concepts<->languages <-> co-creating

the poetics of Beowulf can be seen as living metaphor, or spore print for the power of one's own will and courage to help one's fate (edited)

understanding the significance of the hand(code) words may help disentangle the critical issues arising from attempts to making sense of the tents of any "new" concepts

there more too it than that

and research paper on all that hand words stuff

but I think very soon I will try to rotary mind map this emerging disembodied poetics

and I have a video edit, that for me

brings everything together

oh that the ethics code to all of this

Bravery in extremity, grace under pressure these are choices that could shape the wyrd(TAO)

for the satorid archtype, this is as good as one is gonna get as source code

for this strange strange thing, that i refer to as satorid

so at the end of the day in Value of Ethics in TE, is to have insight, lil wisdom "token" that reminds us Bravery in extremity, grace under pressure these are choices that could shape the organic way things actually flow...

that is not a cheat code

that is source code

and I think this goes to this trust issues, it was easier for me and my teamhuman to come to trust, because let's say we are more of the same memetic tribe, but there was a point

were one of us just had to be brave and jump into trust

so that we can freely and really connect and exchange to see if we can move pass just talking about this is a good idea and yeah I see that

to yes, yes WE can do this and that, well ok we need to prep this way first (edited)

Shaman role is Bravery/calm in complexity

so there has to be a lil trigger inside every shaman, to be like fuck it, I guess I am the one is gonna have to set himself on fire, to show everyone I'm legit

and perhaps a paradox, and one of those wyrd things were the shaman role is the leaderless leader so part of that, perhaps when the penny is standing right side up instead of landing heads/tail, they just


later they explain everything in wyrd poetry

or strange incompleteness theorem

its hard to explain the gremlins in the machine



ooooOOOooo just a silly thought that we should do, have us in a creative jam sense, talk about interstellar or any other movies/media that seem to oddly fit


I think doing like list of "top" 3, I think it should be about the "first" 3. this thing jack like to say, first thought best thought, but its working up to freely being comfortable, saying what you actually making connections to inside your mind

then to meaningful express them


but i think what i'm saying along with everything that has been self reflected, but there are safe ways already to culturally "hack"

buddy system is one of them
 <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f49e.png" width=20 height=20>

is about sync "vibin" with some you feel like you can be yourself (edited)

I been also to kind of give everyone in 0mega what i'm really thinking

that this NFT Redux, mind mandala, is a way to construct a pop up Imaginarium

that you carry around your pocket

pull on crypto-flower string, flow thru your imaginarium eco-system, what type of co-creativity you really feel like diggin into today

I don't know, maybe just a nice walk under the moon will be just ok

i do my best writing, when no ONE is awake in the city of falling angels (edited)

well @Jolly LaMa just got blenderBenderPreRender fired up and roasting some beans

that can tickle curry's brain

well well that IS an imaginarium string I want to play

which reminds me @Mert Ozd and @stef I would like to reach out, so if you want to we can sync up, in my imaginarium way. I am working on some new edits, and would be nice to bounce thoughts and ideas, just on like 0mega workflow stuff, so we can have easy media aids we can all use, to toss to new/OGs (edited)

you need to understand its pattern, there is something interesting I was talking to jolly about, that one kitchen the Chef only spoke Chinese, I don't know Chinese, but I do speak Kitchen, I understand the context and when can "read" Chef. so i don't know the language, but I know the context and the patterns so we can work and play together (edited)

also think about playing a game, baseball there are probably 10 different primary languages each individual player uses to navigate reality

but they all know how to play baseball

so one player doesn't know Spanish and the other doesn't know English

but there the best pitcher and catcher in the league and of all time

well in my new way of expressing some thoughts

well they have energetic poetics

there motion together is unified

even if there are no real words

being exchange

there is all sorts of real value flow exchanges

maybe something like this invisible ecology of mind

in this context of disembodied space

is perhaps what I am saying is useful, meaningful to research in this context

[what do you mean with "source code", what compiler does it need? are there some comments? architectural diagrams? In what language is it written? Do I need to learn its language?](about:blank#)

<h3>SatoriD <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/231778204950462464/90cf52144e549873da3fc78f82373f58.png" width=25 height=25></h3>

_01-Apr-22 09:20 AM_:

Bhagavad Gita might actually be something like the architectural diagrams for the mind palaces of those poets of the oral tradition and even philosophy

there is also some technique stuff and about working william blake poetry, and speaking it out loud, that I think I am beginning to understand a lil bit more, what he was really trying to teach, that in napora archive

and for some reason I think "pattern language" wind talkers, maybe having something that we can decode, so we can code into a new context

@Jolly LaMa maybe in the I want to play more thread, can you drop in links to that podcast you were referring too. that would be a fun thread to pull on, and we have research pools to say hey this is a very meaningful connects, and we do some "tokens" of wisdom that we mined in those rivers..

@solsista @Letty @nic I been thinking about this too, like this first phase of work on the roles, archetype and poetics, is me working out the prototype, so I can help others, do the same for the other roles. just poetics, tao logic and shaman wyrd, is like my wheel house and I have to do a lil bit of learning from my friend, but we can already put ideas in the different roles buckets, and doing lil quick first 3 list. maybe anyone interesting, do a quick first 3 connects that pop into you mind about the roles. so next 0mega we make time to share some of first 3 connects

so for me source code for satorid is = disembodied poetics(unlocking the wyrd) + maybe logic(Robert Anton Wilson) + Ah Xoc Kin(song + flower = <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f33b.png" width=50 height=50> <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f31e.png" width=20 height=20>

or imaginarium). which is "type" of shaman, in the bee shaman way

artist is for me curryhobo, alex grey scared mirrors and mandala scared scaling(gift culture of the indigenous) and some dreamtime logic for good measure.

for system thinker I pulling from Learning From Leonardo, and i think the over all body of work of Fritjof Capra, along with ecology of the mind, so the pool of wisdom I want to eternally connected too

I think for this part, what are your 3 must read for DAOs

for coder/builder, I pull from me being a punk, cook, and my friend mindsgaming. being a <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f977.png" width=50 height=50> <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f3fe.png" width=20 height=20>

. in the kitchen I did really learn how to be a fucking badass, just task master, that you can begin to play chess on the kitchen board... and I have some actually coding experience from way back when.

beginners mind, zen lunatics, to be able to not take myself to seriously and always always knowing that at some point, I need to find someone that actually knows more than me so I can really learn from them (edited)

kind of my list in stream consciousness way....

because for myself, this was a turning point, after that meeting, well this is where we make the design for the imaginarium (starship).

_04-Apr-22 08:44 PM_:

this doc is for WG 0mega groundwork (the "redesign" I've been mentioning), which basically got triggered by @Mert Ozd initiative, identifying that TE Ethics and also the Transdisciplinarity requires more groundwork (and actually topics that we discussed in the first TE Ethics focus groups have beend those that we naturally had groundwork during past 1-2 years)

It is a first draft to bring it all together, please see the comments

I sparred with Mert on this

and we'll continue refining, this should capture all active contributions of the past and present, a pattern that can be replicated in the future, when run, we know it will produce a value add to the TE (Creative) Commons

I see how some initiatives can flow value back to TEC#0mega - without the need to spinoff a DAO, but just defined those flows...


I'm not OK with making TE Ethics dependent on a business case, but I'm OK with it growing as the interesting TE Ethical questions get populated and investigated and flow into Participatory Action Research

but does that mean or shrinking activity with shrinking interest? are we then any better than the business world that forgot about social responsibility - or handles that as a marketing factor?

maybe that is a fundamental question of TE Ethics... do we need to sell it? make it sexy? or is something fundamentally missing if that was the case

the minimum we need to achieve is that those who do want to research TE Ethical topics and make the outcomes useful resource in TE Commons know how to do that


and one more insights, working on this doc makes me realize how big of an effort it is to make sense of it all, not to truncate the complexity for a simple let's do x, y, z - but put effort in systematizing and collecting & incorporating all perspectives that then can be described succinctly

somewhat (un)related to this weeks agenda - but related to all of this:

this book was written 16yrs ago, and one of the critiques says: ""His unwavering belief in the greater good offers hope for the future but fails to adequately address the present, leaving readers to wonder what he would have said about the prospects of another decade in which the industrial information economy, backed by powerful lobbyists and defiant legislative activity, holds all of the cards. Would our future look so cheery then?"" we are in this future, look around, what do you see - what do you think is the reason?

ohhh and it's got something for @Mert Ozd too "So time management ‚Äî the process through which we order our actions ‚Äî is really *behavior management.*"

(but ok ok we'll keep the research question focused... but kinda well... it is complex <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f609.png" width=20 height=20>

maybe we can map out the incentives space ...currently playing with a piece "It's DAOs all the way down" on self-organization )

but in the regenerative workflow research this definitely is a topic

!praise @nic for the robust design of archipelagos it supports very well in weaving the threads of 0mega


!praise @Mert Ozd for handling the process work to get inflow of funds and for identifying the need for research as ground work of 0mega


let's make use of this Wednesday to nail down improvements in identifying how to channel energies of participants, identifying the needs of the initiatives (funded and to be funded), and sharing the responsibility in documenting what has been / is being done in a way that fosters self-organization and creates room for "apprenticeship" or rather opportunities to learn from each other

one more interesting aspect, there they have given examples of content creation for each type of flow... we could give examples for the type of work we do... maybe not possible for all - but would be great for self-reflection and also for making "our stations" such that people can not just look over the shoulder (which is really tough through discord and asynch <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f609.png" width=20 height=20>

Yes, anyone coming with a different blindspot mean holding a different worldview on what has the more value at that specific point of time/paradigm so actions and needs would differ or be "valued" very differently.

What about stress-test engineering or risk scenarios: e.g. current IT disconnections, energy infrastructure supplies, satellites hijacking ---> what is it that remains even with those? that would be the "intrinsic purpose" or safe reset button.

Yes, that research proposal seeks to explore this more in-depth. As per @solsista energy incentives, these fire very readily in the immediacy of natural connections (hard to collect links in the library if no spontaneous mechanism is happening or there's not an instantaneous container to receive curations/synapses firing).

**TE Consilience Library**

**How to Contribute - Join our Playgrounds:**

manifesto, agenda, video manifesto, work style miro and deb/puzzle/ethics figma links This can help populate Stef's website. I kept the original seeds curations. Though I don't see anymore the blocs/gallery as the MVP for further curations. What is emerging is that

**CONSILIENCE**

is our overarching theme, and we're consiliencing around with initiatives: library, ethics, groundwork. This understanding may help give structure to inform our proposals wording and all initiatives on process.

**Welcome to 0mega**

‚ú® Participating in 0mega is a practice of integrating learnings (around crypto economic flower and more) into our being, our actions, and our creations. We are all on our independent journey of learning and when we visit 0mega where resources around the crypto-economic flower and more are shared, we learn from the resource itself and the connections formed from the interactions around such topics. We apply those learnings to our lives and creations. We are not told

*how*

- we all have our own individual ways of integrating and applying.

**Imaginarium Creative Flow**

- explores learning by play and creative performances -

**Regenerative Workflows Research**

- explores creating systems that honour our humaneness and our being part of nature -

**Dynamic Energy Budget**

- explores viewing systems through the lens of energy flow, as part of Regenerative Workflow Research There are lots of resources shared in the threads. Participate by discussing, sharing ideas, sparring. Right now all the research is focused on integrating learnings with the creation of the Token Engineering "Consilience Library" experience.

yeah, having this space in mind where the content constellation of the figma board hangs out, kind of sci-fi, with artworks expanding in multiple layers of backgrounds. which 3d tool would be light enough for creating and letting users wander around this environment within a web browser?

from a "getting things done perspective" the most active areas in the coming weeks will be

- TE Consilience Library
- Onboarding to 0mega

_06-Apr-22 03:48 PM_:

this here


We need a concentrated and concerted effort from the ones who have been contributing to document their work


We need TE Consilience library participants/contributors to decide how they want to play:

- execution mode, get protoype/phase 1 out quickly ? (setup bounties, DeWork) or (edited)
- experimentation mode, test hosting multiple workflows (creative, energy), experiment with funding flows (straight UBI? experiment with mechanisms?)

or a mix of both?

_06-Apr-22 04:01 PM_:

it would help definitely also focus the "research on regenerative workflow" to focus on specific workflows to make the lib novel _and useful in its first prototype

ok, this is how it could work I think, I can help the "research group on regenerative workflows" to accompany the work on the library

so we will have weavers between the creative / energy / process workflows, all concentrated on the TE Consilience Library (edited)

yes there too in the collaboration we can focus, especially wrt the grammar of the "energy flows", on the TE Consilience Library (but that should give insights, or be applicable of course to the rest of the islands)

_06-Apr-22 04:08 PM_:

so yes, just to "household with our energies" we'd be zooming in on parts where we have the most concentration , hence most insights to be gained

once the TE Consilience Lib / workflow (energies) research /onboarding feedback is cleared, on track

we can then zoom out, or branch out back to other islands (e.g. TE Ethics needs me, and I need some more supporters etc. but that is not as crucial as getting the TE Consilience now off the ground since it is the most energized area

Dark energy hints hidden in cosmic voids

co-visioning, peer learning, [incentives is a big one and deserves a longer exploration], mutual support/peer production, flow

incentives...

as a CEO/manager 80% of your time is well spent on designing incentives, the other 20% org/comms structure

if we're just swapping the one CEO (and their board and their investors) with a TE (and the founders and their investors who pay him (yes white male dominance is a constant) I don't see us doing anything differently, just using cadCAD instead of Excel (which does make the world a better place <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f61b.png" width=20 height=20>

_08-Apr-22 01:55 AM_:

so been thinking that underneath "workflow island" we can have the 3 "Process flow" - "Creative Flow" - "Energy Flow" (maybe as triangle, so we can make cross connections)


and then we can add these procedural tasks (Mert & I will document properly) underneath process flow

creative flow takes you directly to play ground via stargate

and around energy flow we synthesize our experimenta/learnings & document how we "engineer energetic value flows and environments" (this is described from my perspective) and all the other perspectives (I know you, Jeanne, Letty have different perspectives viewpoints and see things differently regarding "Energy flow") (edited)


I have this image in my head, of people "shine light" from where they stand, initially the light spheres might be go on many different directions, illuminate the dark, people feel safer, but still you know... "what are we even trying to do here"... but then they actually start enjoying playing with these spheres of light, appreciate the light of others, learn how to move in space (which was previously dark and well disorienting), ... and then all of a sudden the group of people sees something like this:



![https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/810180622634844202/961869056611352606/unknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/810180622634844202/961869056611352606/unknown.png)

the most illiminous area is where effective coordination and collaboration can happen, but it's not static

newcomers will feel less disoriented, go to the most illuminous area but also you know enjoy the light show, or play of the spheres

others might every now and then be brave and explore shadow, new, dark, unknown (to some this may sound frightening, to some this is their intrinsic motivation)

it is natural that "progress" looks different in those different spheres

so here's the challenge - how do we value the essense that makes such play of light spheres possible, how do we incentivize for the most optimal flow for individuals and the collective spheres?

_08-Apr-22 01:07 PM_:

By the way, there is a "research" group in Gravity with a bunch of students who are somewhat recreating our work here. I popped in and told them about this group, and I hope one of us might pop in and talk to them a little. They want to "publish" also so it's a little bit of a redundant effort in my mind. [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1koGb6Uk6hdBftLNd8_vi5A6W7Vrg26XRyAab1Rj8jF8/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1koGb6Uk6hdBftLNd8_vi5A6W7Vrg26XRyAab1Rj8jF8/edit) I'd like to be encouraging to them but what I heard today sure seems like they are redoing a lot of our 1.5 years of work. So, rather than showing up and seeing what they can learn from us, they almost are acting as though they are doing original work inside a space where a lot of original work has already been done.

Beginner Mind, deck/card set; the transcontextual unfolding process of the crypto-flower, petals, errors and colors. Ebbs and Flows, coalescence of failures over time lead to lessons known.

[By the way, there is a "research" group in Gravity with a bunch of students who are somewhat recreating our work here. I popped in and told them about this group, and I hope one of us might pop in and talk to them a little. They want to "publish" also so it's a little bit of a redundant effort in my mind.](about:blank#)

[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1koGb6Uk6hdBftLNd8_vi5A6W7Vrg26XRyAab1Rj8jF8/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1koGb6Uk6hdBftLNd8_vi5A6W7Vrg26XRyAab1Rj8jF8/edit)

I'd like to be encouraging to them but what I heard today sure seems like they are redoing a lot of our 1.5 years of work. So, rather than showing up and seeing what they can learn from us, they almost are acting as though they are doing original work inside a space where a lot of original work has already been done. So, I'm a little perplexed as to how to approach this.

_10-Apr-22 09:51 PM_:

Is it possible that the Gravity group would want to collaborate with Omega to make the Consilience library a reality? It seems to me that this group would be a good candidate to manage/ take charge of/ or curate the development of one entire petal or section of the crypto flower. One of my favorite pastimes while I was at university was just strolling through the stacks at the library. I would pick a topic, look up and find a book and then wander the stacks, pulling books at random and just cracking them open to see what passage my eyes happened to fall upon. I guess it was a form of analog web surfing. Anyways, I don‚Äôt think a library can be made per se; it can only be accommodated, facilitated, or enabled. Maybe in this case it will be more born than facilitated.

Can I just mention how this Blender design connects so well with many of 'Omega' themes? The 'time nucleus' topic: a maze of 'dark or unseen' energies when you onboard that will become relevant with time or energetic firings... And the 'level of consciousness' color in which anyone onboard (aka AQAL) knowingly or unknowingly: teal surrounded by a light purple...a level of potentiality or non-knowns in which any non-predictible action might arise... also the oracle... the mirror...

SourceCred (The Organization) Is Winding Down

I. Intro / background The organization that is SourceCred has been struggling for a long time now. The contributors who remain have decided to let the organization die to make room for new things to grow. It‚Äôs been a wild and wacky time here at SourceCred. We were preparing to do a big organizational overhaul, and a question arose: did everyone...

"Under capitalism, death is evil. Organizations must grow and grow and grow, or be swallowed by another organization, to be ‚Äú‚Äùsuccessful‚Äù‚Äù. Fuck that. Sometimes things need to die. When things aren‚Äôt working, the only way to grow is to acknowledge it. We‚Äôre composting the SourceCred organization, thereby returning nutrients to the soil. I look forward to seeing what new things will sprout and grow." I wrote this yesterday when I posted this mixtape called Creative Partners in ArtCrimes: Kill all your darlings its time for wyrd play cheat the landlord but never cheat the muse

the last line is from William S Burroughs, he is right, fucking lie, cheat and do what you got to do with the landlord but never pull that shit with the muse, when the TAO howls, you better listen homie, the winds them are changing...

WG 0mega - Agenda (Weekly Wed. 8PM CET)

[exploratory phase doc] As of 09/06/2021 Agenda & Notes of Working Group 0mega Weekly Wednesdays 20:00 CET, in 0mega Voice ChannelShort Description The Working Group 0mega started with a rather big question of ‚ÄúHow can we enable Token Engineering Ethos to emerge from such diverse backgrou...
super nice to see that Creative Flow, and Energy Flow are fusing <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f609.png" width=20 height=20>

in #deleted-channelcatching up now <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f642.png" width=20 height=20>

looking forward to next week

my guiding question will be how do we infuse process flow and/or TE C'Lib workflow with it

imv Onboarding is a catalyst for all this fusion to be able to happen

in the 0mega scheme of things, the TE C' Lib level too

and maybe even as "export" product <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f609.png" width=20 height=20>

one more thing... I definitely see a TE Ethical Practice emerging, egen in the 4 initial principles we surfaced... so definitely want to put back more energy into that (personally in couple of months! but happy to support all who are into TE Ethics now)

[http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Practice/](http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Practice/)

[Stephanie Elie](http://www.corestandards.org/author/c0r3-admin/)

Standards for Mathematical Practice

"a balanced combination of procedure and understanding. Expectations that begin with the word "understand" are often especially good opportunities to connect the practices to the content. ...who lack understanding of a topic may rely on procedures too heavily. Without a flexible base from which to work, they may be less likely to consider analogous problems, represent problems coherently, justify conclusions, apply the ...to practical situations, use technology mindfully to work with the ..., explain the ...accurately to other ..., step back for an overview, or deviate from a known procedure to find a shortcut. In short, a lack of understanding effectively prevents a ...from engaging in the ...practices."

could easily fill in the ... with token engineering and te ethical practices

Interesting take on sourcecred you probably would have enjoyed any of the conversations we had at length about the composting weve been facilitating. Many discussions about getting more affluent in transitioning through changes and death as opposed to this insane growth mentality / fetish associated to capitalism. We're simply having a growth spurt. Some people have a hard time knowing when it's time to move on. In reality sourcecred is going through many breakups all at once less so much a death. It's very much alive there just won't be money driving "progress" anymore. [ <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f92c.png" width=20 height=20>

I'm thinking it could be part of many of our offerings actually, instead of a POAP you have a "summary talisman of your discoveries" (this is what came to mind stuck on the road )


I think @Letty already hinted at this, but it took me this long to get it haha

like you take part in any of the TE Ethics practice sessions and digest your self-discoveries, and imprint them into NFTs that part visualize the general themes of those sessions and part your personal insights


@SatoriD @stef wdyt? is this possible? and interesting for artists to contribute to?

yes i recorded the main part when we talk about the self-discovery game. and we are thinking phase one is self-discovery guide to the Library, you have 3 different version of the crypto-flower: process,energy,creative

i'm gonna work with @streamerd to work on a lil protype and i'll map out the "rough" story board on figma

so there is front end UI and then the research/creation backend

yeah the working/research groups gets their "starter" talisman and then it for groups what they discover to add to this talisman

for those engaging with the Library and the begin game

gets "gifts" of our insights and wisdom

that we curate and share within our groups

the "cards"

the next phase is group dynamics and explore the roles

@Jolly LaMa stargate, we can spin it for some wanting to explore the "roles" and how they fit into creative group dynamics

or you can "choose" your role too jump in (edited)

I think @Letty was seeing something like these are "avatars" we shape

one thought I want to bring and add to doc

3 modes: -solo - async, individual insights, research/creating -group - co-creating, creative contest and meaningful novelty & interconnections -unplug -staking "creative commons"/gifting wisdoms, sharing tools, meaningful connections and valuable novelty, metabolism/digest (edited)

then you can add your wallet and get a NFT of your faction

its kind of invert, in which our game helps you to self sort yourself, thru the cryptoflower/library/inner game

creative/wyrd slot is were "random" payoff comes, its nothing to "game" just a token gratitude, insightful web3 wisdom

energy is where we "connected" dots, why we are using these concepts and the way we are thinking and how that connects to how we do it in the process


and in the process and lead you to research work and in the invite to the group

hehe, yeah, it finally comes round circle... we talked once about "writers/librarians minting chapters or curations of "the book" to publish/get rewards. Now phase 2 emerges as a redesigned onboarding coupled with a self or collectively curated library energised by a "discovery or talisman game" that enables all flows to be connected and deployed in a mindmap/mandala way... honestly, who wouldn't want to curate in this way? A really novel and interdisciplinar way! Incentivized by a connective web of NFTs accruing value and energy over time!

and what @durgadas sometimes pokes at as "scientism" or "burocreacy" seeing that being a computer-aided human system... (also check [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor%E2%80%93network_theory#The_actor-network)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor%25E2%2580%2593network_theory#The_actor-network)) we will always break *some things* down to 0s and 1s

Actor%E2%80%93network_theory

we will be utterly analytic (job of a systematizer, and synthesizer)

however 0mega is about doing this in a wise way


integrating "complementary opposites" of play

getting things done

vs. knowing what is worth to get done

whilst knowing our limits to knowability

and as Dana says "strategically, profoundly, madly letting go"[https://donellameadows.org/archives/leverage-points-places-to-intervene-in-a-system/](https://donellameadows.org/archives/leverage-points-places-to-intervene-in-a-system/) (edited)

[Kindle Loomis](https://donellameadows.org/author/kloomis/)

Leverage Points: Places to Intervene in a System

By Donella Meadows~ Folks who do systems analysis have a great belief in ‚Äúleverage points.‚Äù These are places within a complex system (a corporation, an economy, a living body, a city, an ecosystem) where a small shift in one thing can produce big changes in everything. This idea is not unique to systems analysis ‚Äî [‚Ä¶]

Yes totally, I second this. In our talks/research @ygg_anderson we're applying concepts from different disciplines (biology/natural sciences) to think about new forms of energising valueflows in a group of users holding "a token". A bit related to this UDO concept (proof of usage) but, if a new protocol name is needed, probably we'd name it **proof of energy** . Maybe a case for a joint research proposal to be dog-fooded?

I have a question.. in the 0mega manifesto, we say we focus on actions, not outcomes but right before that we say

‚ÄúIt takes as long as it takes‚Äù - Sparrow The initiative proposals should be no longer than 2-3 month iterations at which end a useful outcome is reached, e.g. first prototype of a living library, initial principles and practice sessions.

Does that mean that if you have an outcome in mind, try to do it in 2-3 month iterations? And if not, then it takes as long as it takes? (edited)

‚ÄúIt takes as long as it takes‚Äù - Sparrow The initiative proposals should be no longer than 2-3 month iterations at which end a useful outcome is reached, e.g. first prototype of a living library, initial principles and practice sessions.

Does that mean that if you have an outcome in mind, try to do it in 2-3 month iterations? And if not, then it takes as long as it takes? (edited)

I feel the "it takes as long as it takes" is definitely our motto in terms of acknowledging brilliant ideas/artifacts/work take quality time to materialize. That doesn't mean we don't aim to have intermediate checkpoints with actual progress being made in shorter cycles (as in proposal, updates, bits of research...)

And yes, we really need some kind of UI for the Consilience Library, sort of this (which will take as long as it takes):

[Yes totally, I second this. In our talks/research @ygg_anderson we're applying concepts from different disciplines (biology/natural sciences) to think about new forms of energising valueflows in a group of users holding "a token". A bit related to this UDO concept (proof of usage) but, if a new protocol name is needed, probably we'd name it **proof of energy** . Maybe a case for a joint research proposal to be dog-fooded?](about:blank#)

_25-Apr-22 08:21 AM_:

I like UDO -certainly the right direction, but not being able to let go of the "user" is one of those signs that "builders" have a hard time to let go of their traditional roles.... reminds me of my marriage and when we got our kid, how we went back to "father" "mother" roles, until we realized, wait a second! we were in this together, and it's not our parents' institution that we live in.... now the three of us have a very participatory arrangement, where everyone needs to take the lead from time to time... especially if it is an area of their concern; (totally committed to embody the wisdom of web3 in daily life haha)

so in the projects I work with we're moving from "user stories" to "participants stories" and those are experience/case studies almost - instead of what developers/modelers assume to know what users think

so user defined organizations, is a bridge "we let you define it, but you're gonna still be the user of it" because we're not there yet... for no-code to function, there needs to be clarity of assumptions so much so that it can go into config space.... ah super exciting space....

_25-Apr-22 08:32 AM_:

"it takes as long as it takes", is when we want the emergence of all three: "the who", "the what", and "the how" ... this was certainly true for the beginnings of 0mega, we didn't want to just write a code of conduct and be done with it, instead we came up with the library and the "Who owns TE Ethics" Participatory Research Action (the what) through interactions... it took as long as it needed, but then "the what", and "the who" became quite clear, as in a foundational group that knows what they want to do, that they can do it, ... the who is fluent, as in people come-in, people take some time off, etc. ... now with those people we're figuring out "the how"

and again in a manner that states "it takes as long as it takes", knowing that the way we work is changing/adapting...

these are current movements larger than TE... but certainly "the transdisciplinary art of token engineering" must concern itself with

I like this Synergy Engine... so it relates as in as soon as "the what, the who, the how" is clear, the group flows in action, likely having all they need to do so... but for that to happen something that makes synergies visible/possible needs to be there, which imv is the 0mega archipelagos, we need 1-2 more sessions on process flow to document it on the board

_25-Apr-22 08:49 AM_:

For the TE Consilience we can do the process flow this Wednesday as well - putting it on the agenda

Also I think we will see that there is not enough energy budget within 0mega to energize all acitivities at once. Then the question is who do we prioritize: "energy flows where attention goes"

where do we put our collective attention, since we have a funded initiative, the TE Consilience Lib, there is also external attention that will want energy to flow there

now the indviduals that will contribute their own energies to make that project happen need to reflect, how can I maximize what energizes me, whilst making sure the phase 1 of TE Consilience Lib will be delivered

*what we're experimenting with is **"self-organization"*** (edited)

what communication/coordination needs to happen, such that a group of people can self-organize and deliver as efficiently as a managed project office.

stretch goal would be: even more effective than a hierarchically managed project office with FTE planning and replaceable human resources: by holding space for purpose - autonomy - and mastery; every contribution should be an opportunity for personal growth:

_27-Apr-22 10:54 AM_:

it kind of works out, gives me more time to make my notes: *William Blake asked the tiger: "In what distant deeps or skies burned the fire of thine eyes?" What struck him in this way was the cruel pressure, at the limits of possibility, the tiger's immense power of consumption of life. In the general effervescence of life, the tiger is a point of extreme incandescence. And this incandescence did in fact burn first in the remote depths of the sky, in the sun's consumption.*

[Hey, here's a request please take some time before our WG Call on Wednesday, please come prepared those of you who (want to) contribute to the TE Consilience Library: *What is the action(s) you want/need to contribute to the Consilience Library that will be the reward in and of itself?*](about:blank#)

to answer your question, getting to build the library (system,app,bringing people together) would be rewarding as it‚Äôs a chance to show we don‚Äôt have to just dream of a better tomorrow and stop there by thinking it‚Äôs impossible or in the far out of reach future. We can show it can be brought to reality starting now.

desire's 'metonymic signifying chain' formula and metaphore >> [https://nosubject.com/Metonymy](https://nosubject.com/Metonymy) & "In clear contrast to it, a construction (exemplarily, that of a fundamental fantasy) has the status of a knowledge which can never be subjectivized, assumed by the subject as the truth about himself, the truth in which he recognizes the innermost kernel of his being. .... Within psychoanalysis, this knowledge of drive which can never be subjectivized assumes the form of knowledge of the subject's "fundamental fantasy," the specific formula which regulates his or her access to jouissance. That is to say, desire and jouissance are inherently antagonistic, exclusive even: desire's raison d'etre (or "utility function," to use Richard Dawkins's term) is not to realize its goal, to find full satisfaction, but to reproduce itself as desire. How is it possible nonetheless to couple desire and jouissance, to guarantee a minimum of jouissance within the space of desire? This is made possible by the famous Lacanian object a that mediates between the incompatible domains of desire and jouissance. In what precise sense is object a the object-cause of desire? Object a is not what we desire, what we are after, but rather that which sets our desire in motion, the formal frame that confers consistency on our desire. Desire is of course metonymical, it shifts from one object to another; through all its displacements, however, desire nonetheless retains a minimum of formal consistency, a set of fantasmatic features which, when encountered in a positive object, insures that we will come to desire this object."

"Perhaps the most anti-mimetic attitude of all is an openness to wonder and a desire to let reality surprise you. It rarely disappoints."


"desire's raison d'etre is to reproduce itself as desire" also rings a bell:

![https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/810180622634844202/968965545464590366/unknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/810180622634844202/968965545464590366/unknown.png)

which makes ethical engineering so hard, because it is so easy to "get people to do stuff" - hence, TE Ethical Principle "Beware of Social Engineering"

imv the only antidote is that people *know what is worth doing and why* and have ageny to self-determine how to do it

what then is the use of token, you ask?

accounting for valueflows, capturing the value, and enabling equitable ownership

(in a fully automated manner... which in almost all orgs I experience are lightyears away still - haha a bit exaggerated, but yes, the usability is horrible, it's still people pushing buttons. I see no difference to all the hour accounting and invoicing ping pongs and reminders that typically go on in b2b, now we do it p2p

_28-Apr-22 12:12 PM_:

the rationale to go for "Collective Curation" is that a lot of the people who have experience in token engineering (especially the ones who have rolled the ball), are also running an organization, or care for more causes, so if they can get visibility, and/or alignment through working these curations out they have more motivation

what I see is mostly empty space when not I or you are documenting for the group


so what happens is that areas that do not get our attention look like not having progress - although pure amazingness happening there


that's what I meant with "I whish the environment design can automate me away" I "jsut synthesize" and make visible


another insights that you also had: the exchanges are actually very enlightening, e.g. when you do onboarding, or you synthesize/summarize what is on these boards in an asynch manner

anything that is sufficiently clear can go to its own board, as TE Consilience Lib is- and anyone yearning for efficiency should bookmark those clear areas and contribute there

TE Ethics Participatory Action Research - Regenerative Workflows - and Play need to remain in synthesis conducing and currently still messy space

Yeah neither are good solutions atm. Am thinking maybe building the library curation UI to allow any media. So anytime anyone feels inclined to share, they share it one at a time and discuss why wanted to share there in the UI. then share the link from the library to here. Inviting others to join discussions. So in the case of the art being made in the Figma file, if it was in its own file, it can be shared here still. Or the articles you shared recently, those could‚Äôve been curations! Then the looking through action happens in the library vs in Figma (edited)

you assume that that is the hold up to participation. Having gone through onboarding, I do not think that that is the case anymore.

Let's focus on TE Consilience Library, and continue our procedural improvements to onboarding there - I think it will make clear what the actual causes are, and how the process/tool/environment design can help improve by addressing those causes


You might say "ppl don't know what 0mega is" and we need to describe precisely so they can onboard - but that defeats the purpose of 0mega: self-reflection, self-knowledge, self-sovereignty... all things that cannot be thought but only practiced


but we know "ppl sufficiently know what TE Consilience Library is by looking at its island"

take a bet, make an experiment: focus on improving archipelagos from within TE Consilience library island, and see whether those insights are any good for also making 0mega onboarding easier without having to spell out "your 10 steps to ethical clear thinking by embodying the wisdom of web3"


so although the steps the TE Consilience Lib could be spelled out, we're going to put extra effort not to fall back to business as usual because it is easier... it's not gonna get us to the step change that we need in self-organization

presenting at the community call I got another epiphany: just opening to discussion (because it might be "business as usual disguised as epiphany" ....these biases have a way on sneaking up on you and sneaking back into <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f604.png" width=20 height=20>

what if we did limit the number of players in phase 1:

e.g. 5 - max 10 seed curations from most active TE orgs and groups and individuals

AND max 25 early visitors in phase 1 for playing the genesis verions of the NFT self-discovery game in the TE C' Lib

this limit is only in phase 1 - like a closed beta ; only in this phase are people getting a chance to have actual poems, soundtrack, or visualizations for their curations, and self-discovery through the cryptoeconomics flower petals

after that, I guess, only what you share - if that inspires a muse - is your chance at getting human artwork (because if we wanted to scale to many more we could not afford all people working on creating art that sythesizes people's journey, and, collective curations)

@SatoriD @stef I think we have found a "closed circular economy" with TE C'Lib and Imaginarium/Minds and Rezgauche that could be scaled with the same repeatable process and value exchange model

@SatoriD just wanted to check if you want the imaginarium to be a weekly thing or only when you set a meeting. If weekly, I can add it as recurring event so it‚Äôs always there

Also could you provide an event description and links to docs if you do want it as a weekly thing

so its seems @nic that 1.30 pm est is the best time.

TEC Omega: Imaginarium Creative Working Group 3 main parts: Disembodied Poetics (Transmedia Creative Commons), NFT Self-Discovery Game, Mandala Narrative Research. All 3 parts "feed" into each other. Note: Dynamic Energy Budget Research Group, a part of ecosystem of Imaginarium, helps and supports, to curate "research" and produce "proof of co-creativity", for future NFT Self-Discovery Game, Build. For Imaginarium Style, this is experiments in "hypercontextualization" or Mandala Narrative. The power of 3, Knowing and keeping knowledge of "all the time", we can let all 3 emerge...and we're using these multiple media we are extending time intervals. Using text, symbols, visuals and audio meaningfully and also we can start cultivating novelty. To Research and have some creative fun.

A wild idea for what would make this library different, (why arweave hosts the background files), would be to have a permaweb base of existing and new, curated material in relation to the 8 petals of the flower (and its corresponding fractal resonances) a library that can make the otherwise lost flux of daily updates, become useful for another millennia of humans..

Focus of v1 is getting a few high quality curations, and through that effort have the Values of Transdisciplinarity, Connection, and Novelty be experienced by learner/visitor in a v1 MVP (building on what @stef provided)

we start the testing within #deleted-channel so let's go there those of us who want to curate 1-3 books that help them make sense of Token Engineering & 0mega, i.e. self-sovereignty, unity in diversity, wisdom of web3


the challenge is to find the few book(s), article(s), podcast(s), or video(s) that you relate to as many, or as impactfully many (i.e. maybe bridging just two disciplines, but really helping with the mindset shift)


thank you all for this wonderful session! love the flow, it really is refreshing <-- I will make an excerpt in the processflow and share in the #deleted-channel

‚úÖ Praise @streamerd for the very suitable tagline for the TE Consilience Lib: "rewards with wisdom" and riffing of cryptoeconomics flower how each participant has/is a flower with their interdisciplinarity yielding a different shade/shape, and visually representing like-minds and complementary opposites to make visible the Lib's Value stock of Connection

_02-May-22 05:12 PM_:

as always I'm convinced that the curation/visiting in and of itself must be worth - hence "rewarding with wisdom" should be the core: anything that someone else pays you to do (sponsoring adventures) that you wouldn't do otherwise is not sustainable. On the contrary, if people are curating and learning from those curations, and making connections through the self-discovery game, and a re just getting a high from that - getting on top of that sponsors for adventures is a source of affluence <-- what we definitely go for... the "inner core" is also what sometimes is called the "flywheel"

_03-May-22 01:38 PM_:

Why would adding adventures take away from the worth of the wisdom gained in visiting the library and learning from the curations? I don‚Äôt understand why both can‚Äôt exist at the same time. Sponsors wouldn‚Äôt be paying you to enter adventures, they will just be paying for the creation of adventures. Adventures will be open for everyone. No one is forced to take those adventures either. Adventures are made up of curations. It‚Äôs just that if the learners are also looking to earn money to stay alive, there‚Äôs also opportunities to be hired by the sponsors of adventures. Adventures can also be created by the learners. That was on the diagram in Figma. If they want to share the specific journey they took through the library they can by creating an adventure. It‚Äôs like open source library tours. Again, am still confused why the existence of this takes away from the value of the wisdom shared. I think it just builds upon it.

Stepping in as a 'consilience interpreter' sort of, I'll let solsista clarify, but you both are pointing to the same: core incentive is intrinsic motivation (reward with wisdom), and Nic, solsista says: adding on top of that sponsored adventures can be a source of affluence (we should go for that).

I just wanted to say that I really want to participate in the energy budget research.

_04-May-22 01:01 PM_:

no, no all good - we just should make sure that creating a curation itself is rewarding and feels like an adventure - so we don't end up with a library that only has sponsored content . But definitely not saying no to " paying for the creation of adventures" , of course not. however, it should not be the only reason for curation. Or put it another way, if curation in and on itself is not rewarding, and people do it only because they get paid - the quality will be very different.

[Stepping in as a 'consilience interpreter' sort of, I'll let solsista clarify, but you both are pointing to the same: core incentive is intrinsic motivation (reward with wisdom), and Nic, solsista says: adding on top of that sponsored adventures can be a source of affluence (we should go for that).

thank you for sharing, and like Solsista said, there's no fault in that.

We're just having technical troubles right now, so will try to come up with alternative tomorrow and ask when you feel like doing the onboarding.

_05-May-22 07:24 AM_:

Thanks @Mert Ozd @solsista & @nic for the warm welcome! I joined TEC a few days after I read some papers about the philosophy of the project with which I feel I resonate. During my onboarding call with Manu he suggested me to join yesterday's omega call, before that I participated in a call with the gravity group and I felt more at ease because I was more familiar with the topic. But I had the chance to do some work with Aragon too and I know that it takes a while before one starts getting oriented inside a Dao, specially a complex one like TEC! Anyhow, if you have another onboarding process to recommend me, I'll be happy to join it. I already signed in for the Graviton training. My background... long story. Basically I'm the type of dude who likes studying different topics... Master of Arts in literature, another master in Counseling/Coaching, I'm a qualified mindfulness trainer and a vipassana meditator and now I'm completing a specialization in Project Management, plus I've taken single courses in a wide range of topics. I worked mostly as a journalist and as a teacher, but I've also run an office for a while and in my past I've been also a professional cook. In crypto since 2017, mostly for trading and educational purposes, but in the last months I've developed a passion for Daos. My dreams are decentralize education (tokens could help a lot running democratic schools built on an updated version of the Summerhill model) and tokenise help (I'll definitely write more about this). Couchsurfing and hospitality is also something that should definitely be decentralized. I follow the crypto poetry movement and sometimes I write poetry myself. One day I will start a publishing house based only on Nfts (which is another topic that really interest me). I wouldn't mind to become some sort of gallerist and help artists to join this new exciting world. I'd also like to start some meditation classes for the web3 world. And this is it



I guess it's your turn now

[Thanks @Mert Ozd @solsista & @nic for the warm welcome! I joined TEC a few days after I read some papers about the philosophy of the project with which I feel I resonate. During my onboarding call with Manu he suggested me to join yesterday's omega call, before that I participated in a call with the gravity group and I felt more at ease because I was more familiar with the topic. But I had the chance to do some work with Aragon too and I know that it takes a while before one starts getting oriented inside a Dao, specially a complex one like TEC! Anyhow, if you have another onboarding process to recommend me, I'll be happy to join it. I already signed in for the Graviton training. My background... long story. Basically I'm the type of dude who likes studying different topics... Master of Arts in literature, another master in Counseling/Coaching, I'm a qualified mindfulness trainer and a vipassana meditator and now I'm completing a specialization in Project Management, plus I've taken single courses in a wide range of topics. I worked mostly as a journalist and as a teacher, but I've also run an office for a while and in my past I've been also a professional cook. In crypto since 2017, mostly for trading and educational purposes, but in the last months I've developed a passion for Daos. My dreams are decentralize education (tokens could help a lot running democratic schools built on an updated version of the Summerhill model) and tokenise help (I'll definitely write more about this). Couchsurfing and hospitality is also something that should definitely be decentralized. I follow the crypto poetry movement and sometimes I write poetry myself. One day I will start a publishing house based only on Nfts (which is another topic that really interest me). I wouldn't mind to become some sort of gallerist and help artists to join this new exciting world. I'd also like to start some meditation classes for the web3 world. And this is it](about:blank#)

@SatoriD poetry & cook, @stef has a gallery in Brussels and wants to play with displaying/making the TE Consilience Library experiental in that setting for people who are absolutely new to web3... which I really look forward to ...so #deleted-channel is a thread where you get to interact with them and maybe share insights about learning and education, the lib has three value stocks through what we bring to the table as a group: Novelty (NFT self-discovery game), Transdisciplinarity (the field itself is, so through high quality curations our TE network can provide), and Connection ( through facilitators, like yourself!)

_06-May-22 01:18 AM_:

I'm wondering there are how many islands in the daocean where similar questions are explored? Also, couldn't an inter-island news service help advance those explorations? If so, who would fund it? It reminds me of a story. When virtual communities were born, in the '80s, unbeknownst to each other, we had various vircomms discussing the same topics on computer conferencing systems running on different pieces of software that were neither inter-operable nor compatible. Responding to this situation, in 1985, the Electronic Networking Association launched Netweaver, an electronic, inter-system newsletter connecting those conversations. (You can find a reference to it in Joi Ito's blog [https://joi.ito.com/weblog/2003/02/15/the-meta-networ.html#comment-2375](https://joi.ito.com/weblog/2003/02/15/the-meta-networ.html#comment-2375) and in my comment below it.)

Its been dense few months since I curiously found my way into Omega, but I write poetry, video/audio edit, and co-creator of Infinite Imaginarium. It seems like there is a lot of your interest overlap with what's been cooking in TEC Omega: Imaginarium Creative Flow. Within our co-creating journey of the NFT Self Discovery Game, I think central to it is how can we use concepts of Open Source, Decentralization and Enabling for Co-Creation, Meaningful Novelty, Growing Connections and experimenting ways to design, build and fund emerging fields of energy, focus and interest that overlap. I also have this Playlist of What Been going on in the Creative Flow: [https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrh1PEXBEkv5bu_ULJRu6mx8I23rl--Ps](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrh1PEXBEkv5bu_ULJRu6mx8I23rl--Ps) (edited)

I started going through the material you people suggested me to read and I started thinking that Daos have this tendency to generate an overload of (disorganized) information, like the bureaucracy of a state that gets more and more complex. This of course it's not a prerogative of tec or omega, it's a constant that I noticed in every Dao I joined (so please take this as a reflection and not as a personal criticism, it is not, I really like you), which makes it harder for new people to join as long as the Dao progresses. Like the more it progresses the more exclusive it becomes. And this doesn't happen for the will of their members but for their very constitution. I also checked the playlist @SatoriD shared with me that I'm sure was created with a lot of love and the best possible intentions. but all together those video make up more than 8 hours. I don't know. Spring is here, roses are blossoming, girls start undressing. Maybe it's Saturday morning and I'm just feeling lazy. I enjoyed the website with the poems and the pictures though

That's a challenge, specially in a ever changing environment. Avoid redundancy, be comprehensive and maintain clarity without killing complexity... definitely not easy. Maybe a layer system could work, but still keeping it up to day would require a huge amount of coordination and several people completely dedicated to that. I personally hate presentations full of links that takes me everywhere, not the case of what you posted, which is admirable and I'm sure that took a lot of time. I enrolled for TE fundamentals and looking forward to read the Hitchhiker's guide.

_07-May-22 05:00 PM_:
we have a digital gardener also newly onboarding /cc @Pedro Parrachia I hope you'll be sharing insights . I love this Creative Conflict


But it is important to note, as long as you have not taken a tour of the archipelagos with @nic expecting to onboard 0mega (especially if you are new to the field of Token Engineering itself) over a sunny weekend is surreal. Don't put that much pressure on yourselves!

this group is starting from and always going back to self-reflection

it is very easy to find sources of conflict everywhere else

anyways some insights and a bit of a train rolling... this brought me to 0mega on a perfectly beautiful Saturday night, idk

(a) I'm greatful for this space

_07-May-22 05:14 PM_:

As said, Durgadas served this image for us to use in a session maybe months back, and after molling over it as a group, weeks later, Letty comes up with this "what about the energy in those dark spaces?" .... and ever since this has been working in my RAM - what I see is beautiful, and would love for us to create whatever we need in "resources" collectively to enable it:

instead if being hung up in leader-follower - becoming "self-sovereign individuals who govern well together" - is the very expression of "self-organization"

instead of asking "what's the vision", "who's the leader"... stressing over "don't have the skills" , can't swim, I'm drawning, we don't have "resources", "what's the action plan"? and looking for answers from outside - 0mega is the place, where we play to learn self-organization, which starts with self-knowledge, which is the source of self-sovereignty

Vision becomes "Co-visioning"..... a group who can master Co-visioning literally has telescope vision, and can see around corners, because Co-visioning is the synthesis of the diverse perspectives.

Skills become "Living wisdom" ... every participant brings in their stregths and skills, we co-create a learning environment together #deleted-channel

Incentives "What do I get?" becomes "What can I give that energizes me and the collective?" intrinsic motivation makes the contributions itself rewarding such that the group always acts from a source of abundance. Any extrinsic reward, monetization/funding i.e. tokenization in this space, becomes always a windfall. Since each contribution was already rewarding to the gifter, we do not need to obsess about how many hours each contributed, to break funds down into hourly rates, which is same old same old factory

Resources becomes "Resourcefulness of the group", which is mutual credit - again this is the source of abundance

Action Plan becomes "Contact Improv" 
[We Rise and Fall Together - Contact Improv - Nathan Dryden - TEDxSa...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbjUPAaqkPQ)

Contact Improvisation is a dance form that evolves from spontaneous communication between moving bodies in physical contact. Touch, weight, momentum, balance, and flow give it a continuously emerging shape. It‚Äôs researched, taught, and performed across the world by dancers from the very birth of the form in 1972: like Steve Paxton, Nancy Stark ...

_07-May-22 05:42 PM_:

of course, they all have the dancing skill... so for Contact Improv in 0mega to work, people need to be practicing TEs (then you know the value of TE Ethics and Diversity), having learnt from a source like [https://Kernel.community](https://kernel.community/) (not only TE Academy, since the curriculum in TEA is engineering-heavy side of the cryptoeconomic flower) - and/or the upcoming TE #deleted-channel

when you ask for "intrinsic motivation" and don't just stop at your minds next best answer , but follow you why after why , you automatically are on your personal self-discovery journey

whatever we co-create here, whatever the output which we aim to contribute to the Token Engineering Commons

we do not focus on those outcomes

but on the action: which is self-inquiry

I asked Fabian "What is the value of Ethics" ...will post in #deleted-channel

a lot of fantastic movements from the 70s got stuck. incl. cybernetics ... and my educated guess is because as individuals and collective/society we were stuck in svadhisthana

...and I'm using this as a "mental model" that helps make sense of the humany stuff that I have almost no or very limited heuristic access to

I don't believe in any of this more than in a cadCAD model a kickass token engineer can pull up - except that survival over period of 5000 years has a higher lindy score <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f609.png" width=20 height=20>

I think it would help if before sharing a new idea, listen to the question, and then share why they want to share the idea (eg specific to that research question of that person).

if too many new people how have not even taken time to read the manifesto are onboarded and say that they are confused, is it more important to onboard more people? or should we take care of contributors who have been consistently showing up for over a year, or are able to just contribute because they have something to contribute.

TEC#0mega is meta as @Juankbell mentioned, it is mainly about TE Ethics and Nurturing Diversity the TE ethos

we identify this divide as a problem:

and set out to find an integral approach

which we found in SPiral dynamics, Ken Wilber, and Nonduality in general

if nothing of the above rings a bell then 1st get those back grounds needs filled

and lets see what main contributors can provide to close those fundamental gaps in knowledge

The TE Consilience Library is aimed at closing that gap too

but it needs building

in context: TE Ethics, Diversity, Unity of Knowledge ~ Token Engineering Consilience.... TE Ethics, Ethical / Clear Thinking starts with self-inquiry, self-knowledge

if participants have methods/insights that they want contributing they are more than welcome to reserve a Wednesday to share with the group

for now sufficient people seem to be interested around nonduality, integral methods that kept the working group going

now we are concretely developing TE Consilience Library to help with onboarding new people into this space as a contribution to TE Commons

that is read: "Token Engineering Consilience" with seed curations that we should get as a minimum

and we have worked out quite a good basis for TE Ethics, Ethical Principles and *potential* practice sessions

We should focus on developing and delibering that basis

i.e. now people should be asked to prioritize and channel their energies into those outlets

and they should be supported in doing so

let's capture this in the process flow of WG 0mega hear you in the voice channel

_09-May-22 05:30 PM_:

I've been exchanging with 3 different (DA)Os today, and all of them have participants that resist and work on finding a way

however, whilst things need to get going they use whatever is available/working now

I guess the importance is not to get complacent and be driven by "urgency"

I liked @Mert Ozd' pragmatic solution to experiment with part of the budget only - that way we keep both systems, which maybe taxing, but we would have people who want to have an execution plan, execute the part of the plan that is (becomes) clear (i.e. bounties are available with exact plan what is expected etc.) (edited)

whilst keep the experimentation with self-discovery into each action we contribute <-- this experiment is voluntary, for participants who know/feel what they are getting themselves into <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f609.png" width=20 height=20>

and/or want to practice autonomy and self-agency in collaboration in digital space across time zones (edited)

in the context of token engineering

if there are no bounties - that means there is currently no one who can tell you what to do

likely because they are busy experimenting new ways, and we protect that creative space, we hold that space

[I liked @Mert Ozd' pragmatic solution to experiment with part of the budget only - that way we keep both systems, which maybe taxing, but we would have people who want to have an execution plan, execute the part of the plan that is (becomes) clear (i.e. bounties are available with exact plan what is expected etc.)  (edited)](about:blank#)

I really wanted to experiment this as most of the web3 space either conducted with bounties or regular salaries. I wanted to incorporate something that value extra energy within social context not only as extra role.

after you left we actually also talked about how, for example, you really want to do research that is relevant in TE, for TEs - but actually are doing the bulk of administrative work <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f64f.png" width=20 height=20>

<-- we're literally wasting TE potential energy here imv

so if we got to a point where process tasks are super clear and bountified, we would be able to free your energies able to flow between admin tasks that you enjoy and TE research groundwork

folks let's make sure that we reflect in our threads in which we were active, what contributions/insights we are grateful for


as we discussed last week, that can help WG Lead and Steward to get an overview: which threads are active with positive energy where progress is happening with ease


please also add what you need help/support with blockages

if we do it by tomorrow, it will support Mert in participating in Stewards Scrum

by Wednesday we can collect those insights also in the 0mega Agenda to to go through in 60 mins

ok added the structure that we stick to now - just so you know, the first part (likely will take 1hr) is update on active threads, we have the topic of Curation Model as a teaser at the end, I think it should directly go into TE Consilience Lib construction

I also added a question whether this model when contextualized to TE C Lib can actually help in co-creation of the experience, instead of experiences designed for people....

so what would be helpful is how did you arrive at the synthesized model, how/what did you do to conextualize in Gravity, what is the essence of the model (this we could all discuss, I think it's good exercise to get those playfulness with models vs. "not invented here" syndrom, or "not my dogma" syndroms etc) - and then maybe we can discuss how to make it useful for navigating co-creative experience and self-discovery in engaging with the lib - as curator (experienced TEs, collective curations) and as learner (new to TE, TEC, 0mega)

_10-May-22 03:57 AM_:

the biggest insight of the past year for me was "Common" is not predefined, but needs to emerge, valuing and itegrating diversity, without prescribing (colonizing) , without compromising (lowest common denominator, everyone needs to lose some) - instead by reaching a higher common ground and/or a more stable fundament/essence (positive sum game, no matter how opposing worldviews might be)

what are the needs of practicing token engineers? how can we enable them to participate more to public good of TE, i.e. in TEC / 0mega?

so that newcomers needs are also met (although, trying to onboard 0mega w/o at least going through TE Fundamentals, reading up on TE etc... is not helping any party) (edited)

just another example:

*what are we optimizing for? what am i optimizing for? How is that affect the TE Commons, i.e. the public good of TE (which cannot be just the xDAI in common pool)*

Co-opoly: The Game of Co-operatives

Co-opoly is a game of skill and solidarity, where everyone wins - or everyone loses! As featured in The Guaridan¬†and on PBS. All players are on the same team and work together to start a cooperative business or organization and compete against the Point Bank Learn and practice skills needed to run a cooperative Make to

_11-May-22 06:16 AM_:

heyy finally through my resistance and walls (maybe some of them haha)

"hosting multiple worldviews" the way we want to host multiple working styles

actually my rational mind finds it great that we have a structure that is both fluent: threads to the left showing energizing acticity... in some people are sharing by themselves just because, in others there's already commitment and/or agreements

we ask and remind participants to reflect on their interactions, learning, especially aha moments and highlights, and praise their collaborators who make those possible

"we are each others' environment"

the energies that we bring into these environments do determine the potential energy for collaborative action

structural inlets and outlets are also needed for creativity to flow into meaningful contributions

we have flowers but we also need bees and gardeners

(just please make sure not to make us "legible")

in regenerative workflow research we honor our humaneness and our being being part of nature

we are not machines, and if all we do is act like machines, our doing is automateable (and should be, imagine you are taking away jobs from algorithms whereas you could be acting in ways only humans can, better, only you can)

consent not coersion

we are all stewards of TE Ethics

do you trust yourself? do you have your biases in check?

if you don't how can you be trusted?

its ok

0mega is the space to find direction

you can play with powerful TE tools, and create digital infrastructures and environments that "make people do things" - you are shaping behavior and incentives

are you legit to do so?

it's ok

however I believe someone else in this group who loves structuring and helping people onboard can do this! and should!! if all they need is a permission slip:

because the WG call's are about that.

I have committed to this as a steward [https://forum.tecommons.org/t/stewards-statement-of-commitment-period-is-open/856/10?u=solsista](https://forum.tecommons.org/t/stewards-statement-of-commitment-period-is-open/856/10?u=solsista)

"ELI5" for 0mega - but for those who are into getting big adventures, the current tagline sums it better imw "*Embodying the Wisdom of Web3*"

so these past exchanges and struggling with my and our collective shadows inspired me to host more TE Ethics Partcipatory Action Research sessions on

*"What are we Optimizing for"*

"

*Embodying the Wisdom of Web3*

*"Hosting Multiple Worldviews"* <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f642.png" width=20 height=20>

_11-May-22 03:30 PM_:

this is similar to how I personally create/synthesise things. I replace clear need or pain point with vision or possibility I want to create. The solution in my case is not actually a solution, more like a representation of what I learned when applied to possibility I want to create. Its existence *could* help but is not a prescription to others' problem. It's more for me to experience and test myself on my problems. (edited)

_11-May-22 04:55 PM_:

This image is what being part of 0mega is about. It‚Äôs a practice of integrating learnings (around crypto economic flower and more) into our being, our actions, our creations. We are all on our independent journey of learning and when we visit 0mega where resources around the crypto-economic flower and more are shared, we learn from the resource itself and the connections formed from the interactions around such topics. We apply those learnings to our lives and creations. We are not told *how* - we all have our own individual ways of integrating and applying. That being said, there is research happening in possible ways people can integrate it into their practice and systems: - *Imaginarium* - #deleted-channel explores learning by play and creative performances - *Dynamic Energy Budget #deleted-channel and Regenerative Workflow* #deleted-channel - explores viewing systems through the lens of energy flow and creating systems that regenerate its participants - *Onboarding to 0mega* - #deleted-channel explores how to empower 0mega participants to begin inner work and grow by self-initiated embodying of the learnings from the resources shared around here (around TE and more) in their lives and therefore own the ethics of their creations (whether it be a crypto economic system or other forms of expressions) Lots of resources shared in the threads. Right now all the research is focused on integrating with the TE Consilience library experience. (edited)

thank you! I think I react when ppl want "tell me what this is" because it's hard to communicate (for me) [and that's my stuff, starting to own it <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f609.png" width=20 height=20>

] - but actually, once through that discomfort, there's always the next breakthrough around the corner, like so:

"an intuition is building throughout the months of mulling over these and exchanging on experiences that everyone is having in other orgs, in TEC, in 0mega: what if we have to peel off all of those layers of memetic desires what if it is not that extrinsic (power, money, fame/status) is "bad" and intrinsic ( what even is that? if you feel good, something "resonates" is that automatically good? good for who?) is "good" what if rewards/motivations don't even matter - but one's "state of mind"

lovely seeing this acitivity ... looking forward to catching up

literally I've seen this in corporate politics, and "leadership", ... why are all these scholars and philosophers let phrases like "only the paranoids survive" be not just normalized but an "ideal" of throves of MBAs flooding into decision making positions!?

not only do policymakers use the models that are proven to be too simplistic

but we literally let these types of CEOs ("reality bending visionary CEOs, whose sole engineering is the social") not just decide over corporations, but let democracy become corporatocracy...

not just normal, but "aspirational"

_12-May-22 03:51 AM_:

probably it is not a person, maybe the one percent of the one percent etc, rather an assumption of 'that's just the way things are' which causes visionary (bush and osama 'talked' both with god) ideology to perpetuate hegemonic systems, but this is just my opinion. I find it remarkable how especially in environments where persons deal with money-power, or gamefied/tokenised systems, these forms can bring out a combination of violent oppression (winner is the best) and sexual arousal (to come/score), which i associated with the dictator game / ultimatum game of game theory. All this is just my dumb self putting things together, so please take it with a grain of salt, i'm not an expert in any field, nor a jack of all trades.

[This image is what being part of 0mega is about. It‚Äôs a practice of integrating learnings (around crypto economic flower and more) into our being, our actions, our creations. We are all on our independent journey of learning and when we visit 0mega where resources around the crypto-economic flower and more are shared, we learn from the resource itself and the connections formed from the interactions around such topics. We apply those learnings to our lives and creations. We are not told *how* - we all have our own individual ways of integrating and applying. That being said, there is research happening in possible ways people can integrate it into their practice and systems: - *Imaginarium* - #deleted-channel explores learning by play and creative performances - *Dynamic Energy Budget #deleted-channel and Regenerative Workflow* #deleted-channel - explores viewing systems through the lens of energy flow and creating systems that regenerate its participants - *Onboarding to 0mega* - #deleted-channel explores how to empower 0mega participants to begin inner work and grow by self-initiated embodying of the learnings from the resources shared around here (around TE and more) in their lives and therefore own the ethics of their creations (whether it be a crypto economic system or other forms of expressions) Lots of resources shared in the threads. Right now all the research is focused on integrating with the TE Consilience library experience.  (edited)](about:blank#)

Happy Monday to all the beautiful Omega team, hope you had an exciting weekend and that your daisies are happy. Question of the week: do you believe that Daos represent an improvement in the conditions of workers (contributors) compared to traditional companies or, being an evolution of capitalism, does the total absence of any form of welfare fail to balance what is gained in terms of freedom? Think about this also considering the learning curve required before being able to be able to contribute to a dao. I would be glad to hear your thoughts on this, I think it is no small ethical issue, and should be discussed

I didn't because I never have time to listen to podcast! But thanks @Jeanne and @Mert Ozd because it sounds straight on point with my concerns! What I'm thinking about is the hiatus between idea and realization. Like: how close did the internet get so far to the ideals of freedom and equity of its creators? Communism was amazing in theory, but what happened in the end? I will try to cut out time to listen to this episode, but as far as I understood, they are trying to foresee a future that no one can see, how far will we land from the dreams of web3 creators? I can see an hyper-capitalistic society instead of post-capitalism, but maybe it's because I'm inherently a pessimist. Will listen! (but if you could sum up, you will have all my love and appreciation) (edited)

[exploratory phase doc] As of 09/06/2021 Agenda & Notes of Working Group 0mega Weekly Wednesdays 20:00 CET, in 0mega Voice ChannelShort Description The Working Group 0mega started with a rather big question of ‚ÄúHow can we enable Token Engineering Ethos to emerge from such diverse backgrou...
@Jeanne mentioned this, and I think it's helpful: people need context in the beginning of the call, and it would be interesting if different people provided that context - maybe even multiple people if they have seen the different mutliple sides of 0mega


so please also be prepared to take one hosting/facilitating, or at least providing context for a newcomer in the beginning of our call

good thing my day jobs need me as respectively token engineer and "manager" (which I refuse, but the organization is still old school, but they are giving me leeway to experiment, and it works, since all people i "manage" are actually either self-employed or lead agile teams in a similar fashion like I do) , so I think I will be able to contribute to some of the threads I see active to the left <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f609.png" width=20 height=20>

Whilst the 0mega collection is coming along very well (a lot about self-knowledge, emergence, network, wisdom... <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f63b.png" width=20 height=20>

) , the organizations I work for need their people/participants to learn about cryptoeconomics on the engineering heavy sides too. So I wonder what are our plans to come up with how to engage curations from "practicing" token engineers.

I think the ReFi curation from Long Tail Financial is one such potential

If any of you is in Germany, Belgium or the Netherlands, spares some time and fancy some performative theater with an amazing director, I vividly recommend to join this show. It explores the relationships between about 70 people inside a Multitud: an aggregate of indipendent people that collaborate towards a common goal: the realization of the show. This differentiate a Multitud from a Mass (people who follows a leader) or a Crowd (irrelated people with no common goals). It's basically a Dao!

Ok, so I'm still musing on the difficulty to get DEB-based measurements applicable to the Regen Workflows in the Library... How to even find a good enough proxy for human to human energies and human to machine ( <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f635.png" width=20 height=20>

) interactions? I came back to humanistic management and thought about the thrivability patterns we work with in Omega. So well-being is substantial to those. Can we include a subjective (self-based) well-being measurement while we curate/work on the Library streams? The OECD library has this for us:

If we can navigate these energies alongside interconnections and time we'll have a good index of well-being measurements of curators related to their curations/energies and a collective gauge. (edited)

‚úÖ Praise @Letty for hosting the Twin Experience for us. It was honestly such an amazing experience. I think your energy specifically created that warm/safe space feeling and helped me feel open to the experience. It's so cool to see the visualisations of the TE Library experience. I'll definitely be trying this nightly. The experience itself was very rejuvenating too, so it's nice to experience this in a place of 'work'. Thank you for being you and in doing so making such a difference!

‚úÖ Praise @bear100 for recording our Twin Experience session and making it easy for us to access and watch again to re-exprience the space. And he was able to do it on such short notice as well. Very much appreciated <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f64f.png" width=20 height=20>

What are your thoughts on doing a soft-gov <> 0mega collab session where we take 14 minutes to do a collective reflection session? @liviade @solsista @Letty How it works is that there are 6 prompts. Participants are given 2 minutes to share as many sentence endings for each prompt as they can. The idea is that participants are encouraged to type what they immediately think of without calculating/rationalising/reasoning away why they shouldn't type it, so as to allow self expression without self-censorship. This way they can honestly share their thoughts. We can do it on figma or people can type under the bullet point prompts on a google doc, whichever is easier for people. The prompts are centred around where they spend energy and how energy flows back to them, as well as brainstorming how to learn from others and share knowledge with others when we are short on time and energy, and what could energise people to share more or be more open to learning from others. Here are the prompts that I'm thinking of asking: - I use my energy towards‚Ä¶ - Energy flows back to me when‚Ä¶ - Ways for others to learn from me without needing a lot of time and energy from me are‚Ä¶ - I would be more excited to make time and direct energy towards sharing my knowledge with others if‚Ä¶ - Ways for me to learn from others without needing a lot of time and energy from me are‚Ä¶ - I would be more excited to make time and direct energy towards learning from others if‚Ä¶ - If any of what I wrote is true, it might be helpful if I... The thoughts shared will be used as part of the user research for TE Consilience Library, as well as Dynamic Energy Budget Research.

[What are your thoughts on doing a soft-gov <> 0mega collab session where we take 14 minutes to do a collective reflection session? @liviade @solsista @Letty How it works is that there are 6 prompts. Participants are given 2 minutes to share as many sentence endings for each prompt as they can. The idea is that participants are encouraged to type what they immediately think of without calculating/rationalising/reasoning away why they shouldn't type it, so as to allow self expression without self-censorship. This way they can honestly share their thoughts. We can do it on figma or people can type under the bullet point prompts on a google doc, whichever is easier for people. The prompts are centred around where they spend energy and how energy flows back to them, as well as brainstorming how to learn from others and share knowledge with others when we are short on time and energy, and what could energise people to share more or be more open to learning from others. Here are the prompts that I'm thinking of asking: - I use my energy towards‚Ä¶ - Energy flows back to me when‚Ä¶ - Ways for others to learn from me without needing a lot of time and energy from me are‚Ä¶ - I would be more excited to make time and direct energy towards sharing my knowledge with others if‚Ä¶ - Ways for me to learn from others without needing a lot of time and energy from me are‚Ä¶ - I would be more excited to make time and direct energy towards learning from others if‚Ä¶ - If any of what I wrote is true, it might be helpful if I... The thoughts shared will be used as part of the user research for TE Consilience Library, as well as Dynamic Energy Budget Research.](about:blank#)

_31-May-22 04:53 PM_:

OK so what I heard is that my genuine concern about the security of this platform is being written off as "extreme" in some way. I am a professional system administrator, and it is literally my job to make assessments for my clients in this way, so it's a considered opinion that seems widely dismissed because... "Discord is popular". So to say that my approach is one coming from some polarized position isn't entirely accurate.

_31-May-22 04:57 PM_:

Extreme? So unidimensional is a synonym of extreme now? What I hear is that you're speaking now with the specific role/voice of a sys admin and treating TEC/Omega as a client. So any statement made with that has a bias in that way. I won't mix those 2 dimensions in any way nor will be going down this stream of thought...

yes Matrix is coming up a lot, I guess it just needs tipping point, migration commitment from the flock. can happen fast as it did from slack to discord


the "unencrypted" part isn't the issue since we're in open source space, but I didn't know the evil side of discord, will learn about it

tbh anythin that sucks less and is more nonlinear yet connected would be heaven

with "curation" features embedded

learnings from today's call: - try not to self-censor, share what you think for example, what should the library be? What should be v1? What should be in v2? - It‚Äôs ok to continue working on ideas, just cause someone works on them doesn't mean it‚Äôs the way the entire group is doing. - We need to work on things until the fruits can be shared. Rather than plucking at the fruit before it exists.

so we're kind of already fully immersed in it and "suffer" the cognitive dissonance that the tools from industrial era giving us (thank you)

so now we need to free ourselves from those tools, so we can shape the new tools that make sense in this new economic paradigm

trying to conform to the "schizophrenia that lies at the nucleus of the capitalist system" whilst we are creating and contribution to a knowledge commons is what burns (me) out

the whole "marginal cost" also applies to factory output - not to people creating


and certainly not to people collaborating (instead of competing)

I think we have sooo many mental models soo deeply enshrined in our (collective) unconscious, we need to uncover and integrate, before we even get to the place where we can create the new tools that support us in collaborative commoning, instead of marketplace competition that detemines "the best"

there will be one deliver-able, that is the one we are able to deliver - a first useful version that has all three value stocks at least as palpable potential to be experienced:

value of connection

value of novelty

value of transdisciplinarity

whatever any one of us does - if it is value aligned with one two or all of the above if will be a useful contribution

again we have the budget to test this with; 15k, people who have already contributed in activities that made that happen, and now also same and more people contributing --> let's distribute some of those funds as @Mert Ozd suggested in UBI fashion, and if people are ok with it experiment with the rest, if we come up with an experiment in #deleted-channel


if not yet, then let's continue distributing - but it is important that we have the alpha community of the TE C Lib also on board

I think next session on soft gov we could see who are those, and definitely people from Gravity as they have some of the best sources and books already read through etc.

_01-Jun-22 03:45 PM_:

well it is the same question of the bigger TEC commons pool in small; yes obviously the contributions should carry through to a usable and useful version of the Lib that participants enjoy and benefit from so much that they want to share energies and funds back

just one example:

![https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/810180622634844202/981645133231562833/unknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/810180622634844202/981645133231562833/unknown.png)

however, 15k is not enough to pull this off - meaning if we weren't going to do it anyways, then the perfect distribution of funds will not make it happen either


ask yourselves if the Lib is something you want to see in the TEC world and if so let's do it

_02-Jun-22 10:39 PM_:

I would like to propose a new call structure for Wednesday calls. Would love to know what you think: **10 minutes - ‚úèÔ∏è Initiatives Updates** Everyone updates the initiative they worked on in the Figma archipelagos including links to their work. In red sticky notes, or in threads, mention problems/blockers, if any. This way others in the TEC and in 0mega working group can keep up to date with what we‚Äôve been up to. Maybe it creates opportunities to jam with each other. Maybe we can support each other when we encounter blocks. Make your energy investments visible. If new to 0mega, introduce yourself in 0mega channel and spend this time to explore archipelagos, or 0mega threads. **10 minutes -  Energy Flow Reflection** Spend 3 minutes writing sentence endings to This past week, I directed energy towards‚Ä¶. Then 3 minutes for This past week, energy flowed back to me by‚Ä¶. Then finally, 4 minutes on It might be helpful if I‚Ä¶. Together, we can reflect on our energy flow and think about how to regenerate ourselves. **40 minutes or more -  Flow** What do you feel like doing now? Dance together? Write together? Do yoga together? Meditate together? Get to know each other deeper? Discuss a topic? Music jam? Let‚Äôs go with the flow. Ps if you do like this new structure, it won‚Äôt be applied until the 15th as next call is Lydia and Felix presenting their research initiative. Will do a write up of updated changes and reasoning (edited) <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f31e.png" width=50 height=50> <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f300.png" width=20 height=20>

_02-Jun-22 11:00 PM_:

I believe this new call structure removes the need for onboarding to 0mega. There‚Äôs centralised sources of knowledge (archipelagos and threads and the calls). Theres opportunity to practice reflection and self leadership. There‚Äôs opportunity to connect with each other deeper. (edited)

I will miss two calls as there's school holiday and we're away with family

Could we have the #deleted-channel synch/harvesting next Monday? Some more people show interest, and I have a new idea, how we could motivate TE orgs to curate a section in the lib, in addition to the beautiful mandalas of @withinthevacuum

Exhausted lol but the new call structure puts the responsibility and the power to share about your work back to all of you


Actually there was some energy that came back to me being able to create what I wanted to which is this centralised source of knowledge about 0mega. I think what exhausted me was my physical body not being able to go as fast as what my mind wanted to create. And also reflecting that when I set my goals this month (which has 30 days) 30 of them are all 0mega. And I realised I needed to pull out of some projects or set more defined boundaries when I do work here. Like I‚Äôve mentioned before I do art by code and design so maybe these other projects can just be self expression rather than I‚Äôm becoming a tool and I provide code and design as a service.

_06-Jun-22 01:43 PM_:

I'm thinking of saying: At 0mega, we practice permissionless participation. This means that the people who are contributing to the creation of the library are following what energises them to contribute rather than being told what to do. What emerged are multiple workstreams each building their own version of what the TEC Library could look like, creating multiple possibilities for the experience. Here you can see the branches of work that exists currently. <Show this [https://www.figma.com/file/soqXUHRrBcazutqC2FegnW/TE-Consilience-Library?node-id=320%3A2198](https://www.figma.com/file/soqXUHRrBcazutqC2FegnW/TE-Consilience-Library?node-id=320%253A2198) > (edited)

[Wish there was a way to still have an 0mega wiki that is easy to update and is free. Only thing I can think of at the moment is Gitbook, but that may be too technical for everyone to freely do on their own, or may be too much of a burden for one person to do for others. We have also tried Figma, but some people's computer struggles with having Figma AND Discord on at the same time. Anyone got any ideas for alternatives?](about:blank#)

Hi Omega crew. I'm working on an update to TEC token holders and am including short bullets on various TEC initiatives.

[I'm thinking of saying: At 0mega, we practice permissionless participation. This means that the people who are contributing to the creation of the library are following what energises them to contribute rather than being told what to do. What emerged are multiple workstreams each building their own version of what the TEC Library could look like, creating multiple possibilities for the experience. Here you can see the branches of work that exists currently. <Show this](about:blank#)

_13-Jun-22 09:50 AM_:

Thanks, @nic. I'm really just looking for a short (15-30 word) summary of what's been done to-date with Consilience Library. Having me write that rather than someone from Omega is likely to not going to represent the work as well as it could be. Here's the context surrounding the bullet (and the placeholder I currently have): We‚Äôve also supported a number of initiatives aimed directly building the field on token engineering. These include: Funding the Token Engineering Academy‚Äôs brand new ‚ÄúToken Engineering Fundamentals‚Äù course, which will be offered for free in the fall and already has nearly 1,600 people signed up! Six months of operating funding for CadCAD, an open source software package that uses simulation to support the design, testing and validation of complex token engineering systems Support for NumFOCUS, a nonprofit dedicated to promoting the programming languages, open code projects, and reproducible scientific research that undergird many token engineering tools Funding for a multidisciplinary ‚ÄúConsilience Library‚Äù of token engineering expertise Funding and incubating a DAO2DAO funding mechanism called Proposal Inverter through the joint collaboration with PrimeDAO, Longtail FiInancial, and Radicle Drips. Running a DAO rewards systems research initiative with the Token Engineering Academy, Commons Stack, Gnosis, Ocean, and NEAR Partnering with the Token Engineering Academy on an introductory class on token engineering

Thanks @SatoriD. I will replace this with what I had. I guess my only suggestion would be to try to think about this from the perspective of someone who has no idea what a "Consilience Library" is or "Testing Omega Collective Curations" or even a "Cryptoeconomic Flower". Is there a way to phrase it so anyone with at least a web3 background would get it? I know it's a compelx project, but I think that simplicity will really help people to get even more excited about it.

@Gideonro is there a possibility to add visuals like these? this definitely is the strong suit currently working on the TE Consilience Lib; and if you know someone (or like you did! thank you!) who can help with communications and wording/marketing from the working groups Comms or Sampo would be great

also what formats are needed, e.g. 1 sentence, 140 chars, forum post update, etc. none of us have that type of skill set, and we only got funding to build this out, and we're maximizing for learning how far we can take the MVP to test the values proposition on: Novelty, Transdisciplinarity, Connection

This message is already done at this point, @solsista. It's going out early next week. I think we got good feedback from the crew here though (see above). I actually went out of my way to get the feedback here in Omega, btw. Hopefully, you're satisfied with the result above.

I know but it is not something that will happen periodically? or in general, it is definitely a need that we have as a WG within TEC - more support wrt Communications

and thank you for interacting with the group and helping to frame the Consilience Lib in simple terms, we definitely need that!

but kind of knee deep in all sorts of other experimentation <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f602.png" width=20 height=20>

that we piggy back onto the Lib building - which are actually super useful research that will also add to the TE knowledge commons. Just food for thought for the group, especially those doing research on/through th TE Consilience Lib, e.g. Onboarding, Regen Workflows, DEB - let's also think about how to explain that in simple terms and/or continue asking for support from better wordsmiths that we know

WG 0mega - Agenda (Weekly Wed. 8PM CET)

[exploratory phase doc] As of 09/06/2021 Agenda & Notes of Working Group 0mega Weekly Wednesdays 20:00 CET, in 0mega Voice ChannelShort Description The Working Group 0mega started with a rather big question of ‚ÄúHow can we enable Token Engineering Ethos to emerge from such diverse backgrou...
I take it partly because the TE Ethics folks didn't show up <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f642.png" width=20 height=20>

@Lydia 's flight got delayed, she messaged me on TG - which I only read much later when I finally arrived at home:

I'm adding it to the agenda for next week - and @Lydia pls use this general chat for coordination WG call agenda, general questions or #deleted-channel for more details on the following:

"Felix and me still have some questions before coming up with a written proposal for the focus groups: Participants: Who will be the participants of the focus group sessions? What is their background? How are they going to be selected? How many shall we expect? Content: How are we going to decide about the actual topic of each of the focus groups (having in mind that we have to narrow down them as much as possible)? Felix would like to propose one on private profit vs common benefit motivations to hold TECH, which of course also has ethical aspects. Do you think this would fit? Do you have strong opinions about what should definitely be there? Format: How many focus group sessions are we going to do? We'd like to do at least 2 and max 4-5. Each would likely take a little less than 2 hours, each with a little intro and about 60-90 minutes session. We will prepare a short intervention of about 20 min for the next meeting (22.6.22, 20.00CET) in order to introduce the structure and discuss the proposed content of the planned focus groups. Please let us know if this fits the group's schedule."

anyone who is interested in supporting the focus group work please join next week (i will happily postpone the "mindful movement" or we can do it afterwards?)

Imaginarium, Dynamic Energy Budget, Rez Gauche are independent activitites/organizations of @SatoriD @Jeanne @stef who (intend to and in case of imaginarium effectively have) connect their activities to the initiatives in 0mega

we only have 1 funded initiative: TE Consilience Library

1 in revamp: TE Ethics Participatory Research

and budding research around Regenerative Workflows (to which Dynamic Energy Budget and Imaginarium Creative Flow fully contribute)

we need to make clear these distinctions, e.g. [https://gitcoin.co/grants/798/a-hitchhikers-guide-to-token-engineering](https://gitcoin.co/grants/798/a-hitchhikers-guide-to-token-engineering) is a distinct initiative outside of 0mega, but we see it can somewhat contribute to the TE Consilience Lib - but I am reluctant to list it, unless we have started to try figure out how, e.g. get to a place where Imaginarium is already - the contributions create amazing, useful artifacts that add value to 0mega initiatives and research <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f4b0.png" width=20 height=20>

as long as it is not yet clear, the space is open to collaborate and find our ways here - but I' reluctant to add it as initiative, since it will create the question of "how" - and we don't even have a thread to point to saying "we are researching the question of how"

makes sense?

we can take up this question maybe in Creative Flow on monday

the threads are great indicator of whether energies exist and are literally channeling: is there a thread? is it active? if not it is not an initiative or related to an initiative (yet)

love to see the threads ebb and flow

see now we're settling in again on the basics and that is health if we do not have energy nor food for thought to feed all potential activities

that doesn't mean anything more than a signalling of effective realities: we can imagine a lot, but what of it can we effectively bring to life in a useful manner

I personally am super unsatisfied that all needs to boil down to "is it useful now?"

and this is the time I always spin [https://nias.knaw.nl/insights/usefulness-useless-knowledge/](https://nias.knaw.nl/insights/usefulness-useless-knowledge/)

The Usefulness of Useless Knowledge - NIAS

In his classic essay "The Usefulness of Useless Knowledge," Abraham Flexner, the founding director of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, defends "the unobstructed pursuit of useless knowledge" and the search for answers to deep questions, motivated solely by curiosity and without concern for applications. The essay is as valuable tod...

and I am not alone <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f642.png" width=20 height=20>

- but we need to be aware of the "environmental realilties"

unfortunately even in public knowledge commons, it seems "stake (token) holders" look for revenues - then this is not open source knowledge commons - AND the assumption is wrong - that we only create knowledege, or synthesize here nor aim to embody the wisdom of web3 because it "pays off" in tokens or fiat

it pays off alright just in many more dimensions than simple smart contracts are yet able to capture.

**this is a paradox** that **we point here to in 0mega** (edited)

and as the saying goes,

**"How wonderful that we have met with a paradox. Now we have some hope of making progress."**

we are about to figure out a way to value clean air without having to botttle it to make it a commodity so that the markets can value it

we don't look up because our frames of references are unable to capture what we need to understand, we need a new paradigm, which doesn't yell at capitalism but just transcends it gracefully


are you curious? do you have an intuition that there is a way? that's enough.

I don‚Äôt want to promise anything as I am following my intuition rather strategising or doing things because it feels like it‚Äôs my duty to. And remaining close to TE feels right for now but again since I‚Äôm following intuition am not sure where I will go in the future. At the moment I felt inspired to focus on a project which I will be doing for the next bit. (edited)

The Usefulness of Useless Knowledge, it was in the early days of Imaginarium, and I expressed this way to a friend "Finally have a use of all my useless knowledge" *The unobstructed pursuit of useless knowledge, and the search for answers to deep questions, motivated solely by curiosity and without concern for applications. They had done their work with thought of use and that throughout the whole history of science most of the really great discoveries which had ultimately proved to be beneficial to mankind had been made by men and women who were driven not by the desire to be useful but merely the desire to satisfy their curiosity.*

it's defnitely infinite play

distribution needs both take the "pain point money" off the table as well as incentivize for ownership (=power=responsibility)

"I will also suggest a silver lining to the ethics of a global movement whose ideology will be of great influence for the future of technology: through this document I will demonstrate that the real crypto movement is not a trade-show of sociopaths in Las Vegas, but a contemporary iteration of the commons movement in the age of crypto."

I believe UBI can be very important tool to distribute resources but like most of the things the matter is how we are approaching it. In the current landscape, we started to hear UBI arguments from right wing politicans. According to many, this is because, with the automation some of the "labor reserve"(people) become redundant. In a classed society, what will you do with those people ? If you dont feed them, it may cause uprising which you dont want. So, you go with a UBI model that does not push inflation go up alot and give those people means of surviving, not living. But if UBI approached as distributing the abundance that we are creating, it is super cool !

This fascinating talk presents the scientific research that shows the interconnectedness of life in the forest ecosystem. It takes us beneath the forest floor where we learn how trees are communicating and exchanging resources. Going beyond the simple view of a forest as a resource to be exploited, it presents the forest as a complex network...

I've made a sequence using wavelength to illustrate different aspects of creation, time and interaction


first the frequency range that we can perceive with our senses

Then we add the aspect of time

![https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/810180622634844202/994023879318196284/Screen_Shot_2022-07-04_at_15.25.59.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/810180622634844202/994023879318196284/Screen_Shot_2022-07-04_at_15.25.59.png)

Infinite possibilities

Interaction / Iteration

![https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/810180622634844202/994024017424035840/Screen_Shot_2022-07-04_at_19.57.04.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/810180622634844202/994024017424035840/Screen_Shot_2022-07-04_at_19.57.04.png)


The source of abundance is in the center of the interaction... where the high frequencies are

in the mind field

I am also wondering why Andrea and Nate who carefully went through *every* thread in 0mega to collect knowledge resulting in the production of important insights and **onboarding prompts** for the library aren't included there.

I understand Mert. It's all good <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f91d.png" width=20 height=20>

Another question, this UBI means it does not matter how much work someone has done, everyone gets the same amount?

In a way, that will force people not to do too much work that they wouldn't do for free. It almost feels like a punishment for not having looked after one's self very well by forcing to do much more work and also work they may not enjoy. (edited)

Also I noticed that Stef wasn't on there and he's been helping a lot even with v1 of the Library in Notion, and with Wireframes and making the other version of the library in github.

Hey @Mert Ozd @nic @solsista @SatoriD @stef Distribution time! In hindsight, the most valuable retribution I've had is rewards by wisdom (at times wisdom received and others wisdom gifted)... We're still in the process of innovatively/integrally/dynamically come up with better and more regenerative workflows that account for our contributions. Til then, it makes high sense to distribute 60% of v1 xDAI 15k as passed by the Library proposal (xDAI 9k). The remaining 40% will still be used to experiment with a DEB/gifting manner as we loosely agreed to.

This is my suggestion, I feel it somehow conveys our contributions since that far away March 21 when we started all this. Pls upvote or downvote (if downvote pls suggest a better alternative) so we can proceed the multi-sig distribution (and send @Mert Ozd your TEC wallet if you haven't done so yet).

Our original understanding was that "bounties " (I hate this word!) were to be included in phase 2. We've had recent incredible contributions by @withinthevacuum and @streamerd who have shown willingness to keep building the library and I've considered those contributions too. May v2 and our timelines be a better representation of our AMAZING work that existing units of account alone can't give enough credit to! (edited)

it does not mean everybody should be rewarded same. It means there is a guaranteed income for everyone. At least, thats what I understand. So, lets say Satori spend more time and create more value than me he may get more. But regardles of the value creation everybody would get some. (edited)

I believe even in v2 we need to develop in a minimally viable fashion - e.g. meaningful connections between curators - curations - learners (this is the core value) - then novelty (which is being designed alongside anyways, because it comes from a place of abundance <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f642.png" width=20 height=20>

) ... the transdisciplinary bit we nailed I would say, even in our test curation in 0mega - it is a very good origin to model curations after

_08-Jul-22 03:06 AM_:

However, I would like to kickoff a redistribution based on this, and based on what "budget" I have: the 1k I have is more an acknowledgement of my general efforts I would assume - it does not reflect my efforts towards TE C' Lib - especially now in comparison to some others, whose efforts (even if new) I would like to boost: so I'd like to flow from the 1k from solsista: 500 to @withinthevacuum and 500 to @streamerd as part of our DEB experiment. From the list, they were the most energizing coming in quite late, but also creating a lot of momentum, and incentivizing to engage more with curations any much more. (edited)

_08-Jul-22 03:09 AM_:

we should start to see tokens/money as one-dimensional information stream, not an absolute measure of worth

let's reflect on the potential of subjective redistributions, as reconfiguring weights ... like that a lot (which was also part of Sourcecred mechanics--- but I think they could have done it with tokens directly instead of emojis (which conflates a lot without improving much)

hey look at us, improving Sourcecred on the go <img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f609.png" width=20 height=20>

also I would like to reflect on "what emotions" such open/public redistributions create ... (we have zeroknowledge tech coming up - so as long as this group can observe their emotions to go through this experiment, we'll be wiser - but not necessarily something that can be expected from anyone, I guess... )

oh so many thoughts... next wednesday!

I actually wanted to share something else with you, there was a "gender" troll in the TE chat, and a I guess young woman felt unwelcome in TE as a woman... now that is something I have not seen at all - on the contrary, I wouldn't have even thought would be possible in this diverse crowd - but I guess, the DeFi wave washed up a big new crowd that the TE culture isn't able to "welcome" - as in huh?!

anyways, of course it reminded me of [https://bigthink.com/hard-science/eo-wilson-what-makes-us-human-paleolithic-emotions-medieval-institutions-god-like-technology/](https://bigthink.com/hard-science/eo-wilson-what-makes-us-human-paleolithic-emotions-medieval-institutions-god-like-technology/)

What Is Human Nature? Paleolithic Emotions, Medieval Institutions, ...

To understand ourselves, our creativity and emotions, we must grapple with our pre-human existence.

![https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/origin-150.jpg](https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/origin-150.jpg)

and then also that "Gender is an institution"

especially gender is an institution institutionalized by our medieval institutions

then that reminded me of: [https://medium.com/block-science/exploring-daos-as-a-new-kind-of-institution-755eb119996b](https://medium.com/block-science/exploring-daos-as-a-new-kind-of-institution-755eb119996b)

Exploring DAOs as a New Kind of Institution

A Dialogue Between the Metagovernance Project and the Commons Stack

[https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/0*cZw-ZPV6jI39YROu](https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/0*cZw-ZPV6jI39YROu)

then I found this:

"The result is that contemporary institutions are often paradoxical and confusing places. On the one hand, there appears to be a drive to escape from the strict confines of institutional discipline and to embrace a de-institutionalised life. On the other hand, there appears to be a continued attempt to extend various disciplinary technologies into hitherto un-disciplined aspects of social life. The result is a kind of double failure. On the one hand, escape attempts from institutional life become grist for the mill for further rounds of the extension of contemporary institutions. On the other hand, when an institution extends its reach, it often cannot deliver on all the fine promises which are made. But this double failure is also a kind of double success: attempts to escape institutions actually open up new areas for institutionalization; the failure of institutions creates many cracks and fissures in which non-institutionalized life grows"

^^ @nic no wonder "onboarding" is demanding... but then I guess self-knowledge is the same level of demanding... and we're here definitely exploring the non-institutionalized life using web3 comm & coord infra (which still needs to mature, some is not even existent yet, e.g. discord alternatives) for values alignment

what is the image for alignment that we mean:

hmmm actually the only component that runs on web3 infra that is in here now about to being used is the wxDAI from the commons pool of an augmented bonding curve

the actual protocol of (re-) distribution is being developed by "self-sovereign individuals" (more like the birds in the flock) (who use the magnetic field - but it is only one component for the complex adaptive formation in flight)

interesting...

"Many birds form flocks, but only a few form flocks that fly together. Researchers call these flight flocks... While the flocks can form at any time, they are more common among certain species in the winter. The birds get together in large groups because there is safety in numbers, and because it‚Äôs easier to find food when you have a lot of eyes looking out for it and sharing information..."

"...His work showed that bird in flocks don‚Äôt just follow a leader, or their neighbors. Instead, they anticipate sudden changes in the flock‚Äôs direction of motion...."

now that is damn interesting

anticipate change

How do some species of birds in flocks perform their wonderful, graceful, synchronized movements? Hint: they don't just follow a leader or their neighbors.

"Bottom line: According to Wayne Potts, a zoologist who published in the journal Nature in 1984, birds in flocks are able to change direction quickly not just because they are following a leader, or their neighbors, but because they see a movement far down the line and anticipate what to do next. Potts called this the chorus-line hypothesis for bird movement."

very interesting... this describes very much my interaction with this group, ever since its beginning... @Letty @durgadas what do you say?

maybe @Letty more as she's been interacting also with hard maneuvre's like proposal deployment, and funds distribution...

very very interesting... we're onto some insights

0mega insights!

:)) interesting - just saw the praise in the channel, and I thought that qualification should be included... I don't see that in praise nore SourceCred... but it is a fundamental piece in Ecosysten Valueflows - of course it is easier b/c it is just the conceptual piece... but that important piece gets lost if our tools don't account for purpose, intention, and quality/value-add wrt that purpose...

sth to think about and spec out... maybe w/ Electric Circus

@durgadas I really like this... DAOs feel like an empty shell...

anyways wanted to share the talk of yesterday [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRkuQViLqcK4sJlj0sRry6tryzjdSIVz3lHrApGD3H20zg7QexG0QbwpqwF1p_rieap5oVXKCayNxdv/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRkuQViLqcK4sJlj0sRry6tryzjdSIVz3lHrApGD3H20zg7QexG0QbwpqwF1p_rieap5oVXKCayNxdv/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000) Look forward to the community survey and finding more aligned aspiring TEs who will appreciate the ethos that emerges here...

so also connected to this from the consilience project: "Open societies face unparalleled learning crises from accelerating change in technology and science. Conditions in the 21st century require individuals and societies to find a new sense of commitment to ongoing learning. Technological and scientific successes have remade the social world, leading to a much-heralded information age. The results for society and culture have included innovative changes in daily life, but also a growing number of increasingly complex public risks and a disabling sense of information overload. We argue that the rate at which information is becoming more complex has started to drastically outpace human capacities for learning. Either we increase our capacity for learning at scale, or we may be forced to abandon the projects and ideals of an open society‚Äîwith disastrous consequences. We all need to recognize the problem and react accordingly". (edited)

_24-Apr-21 06:46 PM_:

I would argue that more traditional foresight or existential risk disciplines have fallen short of the enormous task of doing sense making for our current and recent conditions. Either they were too focused on one or several verticals within the tech/scientific continuum or were biased towards providing insight to a given invested policy maker. On the other hand, more humanistic social tools available to provide meaningful narratives for a complex world have been enmeshed into the growing trend of polarisation and dualistic antagonism of politics/public discourse. So the emergence of this kind of body of knowledge brings hope and some kind of awareness to the "challenges" we're signalling to. (edited)

This is a fundamental question, because without good sensemaking, we cannot even begin to act in the world.

_29-Apr-21 04:45 PM_:

Personal note on my part: I've also been very invested in this consilience effort as a watcher/observer/thinker. I fully support fellow directors in their efforts of "not" sharing their "interpretation". That allow US to still be active participants both in the projection and what's projected. The Matrix will live through "history" as a "cult movie" for sci-fi fans and for providing the most-groundbreaking reality frameworks for millions of viewers at the time. For W lovers and Self-actualization adepts, "Mount Atlas" is a worthy recommendation

please add, and include your reasoning, e.g. accessible? the perspective the author has? (political scientists' perspective to game theory indeed! interesting) etc. feel free - what "experts" might suggest as reading is not always the best for "getting started" so a "learners" point of view, explained well is even more useful for TEC who aims to get more insightful and value aligned people involved - hope that made sense

I'm actually thinking that adding the links there and then having @ddan supercurator port those to github/gitbook may be duplicating work Suggestions: 1. Create a specific repository with titles under TEC github adding curators as contributors (is github good for visual usability/graph diagramming? No) OR 2. Going for Notion using the same titles/contributors collaborating there (Notion doesn't have graph nodes) OR/AND 3. Doing the Github repo directly with collaborators AND using Obsidian to port (note takers are migrating to Obsidian, we can have nice graph nodes built there with the meta-data links (nice crypto flowers visuals) Any thoughts @ddan , @Juankbell (who both already started linking!), @liviade @durgadas ?

this is great! Let's synch this Wednesday

I'm thinking for the other initiative, we should have an "onboarding" like we have with the ecosystem valueflows course - and an actual offering for people to learn about ethics in token engineering, and our insights about worldviews and deliberate developmental organizations etc.

@Letty please make an additional proposal for The Consilience Project

<img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f642.png" width=50 height=50>

we then link to these from the WG 0mega Proposal as its initiatives, and the initiatives get funds hopefully

I'll do *prepare* the same for Ethos of & Ethics in TE initiative --> and we can synch this Wedneday

_27-May-21 03:42 AM_:

After our call, we had the stakeholder interview with a team of aspiring Token Engineers who take the Ecosystem Valueflows course - it was inspiring and englihtening for all, to tell my story and ask for theirs. @liviade also mentioned this in our call yesterday

After that - it was already past 10 pm, I felt energized deeply (like the opposite of coffee - not agitated energized that kicks in and is fleeting, as @sbilbao mentioned yesterday in our call, too, this "energized but opposite of coffee)

So I continued reading what another fellow participant in the Ecosystem Valueflows course recommended for our work at Team 6 "Electraseed Fund" (there are 7 projects, and peers learning together and from each other working on a project with actualy stakeholders in reach) - the book is called "Who owns poverty?" and it is the journey of someone who dedicated their life to "solving poverty" only to learn... well I guess what we're about to learn by mebarking on this journey together:

**"Who owns Ethics?"**

Interestingly the author, explains his aha moment when he met with Wilber

_27-May-21 04:15 AM_:

The other initiative "**The TE Concilience Project**" is very much related - there too we have come up with an interesting question: "Who own TE Knowledge"? The expert? The learner? What does it mean to consilience? Martin Burt referes to Pedagogy of the Oppressed (which came up a lot during the preparations of the Ecosystem Valueflows course - especially when referring to "A Moral Interface for Token Engineers") - Martin writes " Students should not be considered empty vessels to be filled with knowledge, but people who need to be made aware of their own lack of knowledge... Freire coint the term **Concientizacion** which is like saying "understanding" or "awareness""... Who *"jumps TE knowledge together?" Who owns TE knowledge? - what is it anyway?*

For me what we are putting together here are the foundations of our information era society, with people who opted out of the industrial era that is long gone (yet many still get preached Lean Startup Method for our undertakings - which is a method adapted from factory optimization, applied to creative endeavors... why I felt compelled to put together Ecosystem Valueflows that helps us put our assumptions into a form that can be input into computer-aided design of complex adaptive dynamics). I am becoming more and more aware of my own biases and lack of knowledge. So this is an invitation to put together a methodology to collectively name TE Ethos and Ethics, whilst we are conciliencing TE knowledge, it's the tip of the iceberg (edited)

A further reminder: "Privacy and civil liberties engineering is an evolving field, and every organization is subject to unique requirements and concerns. The ways in which these principles are realized will differ among products and organizations. But the end goal should be the same: developing and implementing technology with a full understanding of its potential effects on fundamental rights and incorporating technical capabilities that can support responsible data handling policies."

in the 0Mega in the voice channel (I think the friendly bot will remind 1hr before) - I'll put an agenda/to-do together, there are some concrete things we need to take care of - then we can take the better part of the hour to pin down the "modus operandi", I think it is becoming sufficiently clear for some ^^ others might still want to add/question or just tag along a bit longer to "get the beat"

to do list will be something like:

1) Short Description of WG 0Mega ( for youtube, onboarding, mentioning in other place etc) [--> update forum post]

2) Manifesto (have a look what it should include, who can put it together/finish it, when) [--> update forum post]

3) TEC Proposal for The TE Consilience Project [--> link from main forum post]

4) TEC Proposal for "Who owns TE Ethics?" initiative (@Letty made a good comment in the current Manifesto [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FM5lokbcJZFXALDfwn-NIjJ1MSUjgoYgecCPwEnTydU/edit#heading=h.x7qmm9h95iaz](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FM5lokbcJZFXALDfwn-NIjJ1MSUjgoYgecCPwEnTydU/edit#heading=h.x7qmm9h95iaz) ) [-->also to be linked, but potentially needs more time]

from point 4) we can move to the "modus operandi" discussion

First things first: Would be great if we'd start with *a minute of "gathering"* again, and maybe try and focus on the "question of ethics" , " who are the jumpers" (see Youtube Video linked by @Letty above on The Consilience)

@sebnem Every attempt to map what is value to humans to a single discrete thing is determined to fail. That's the core contradiction of capitalism. These talks about ethics is just to feel good, when in reality a token economy will be the most totalitarian regime that ever existed. Sry

certainly have a few more to add, it's good to have friendly reminders! once we have filled what we can and know which curators we're missing would be good to "clean" up for some outreach? --> also remember it should have a TEC Proposal forum post, to get feedback/garner interest

Want to share a few links re. Ethics & Algorithms, whoever wants to jump in:

what are similar concern areas wrt TE design decisions? I'm also suspecting, since we're all about decentralization, participatory networks etc. there's also more emphasis on "explainability" "education" within TE that doesn't only concern how TEs make decisions but particpants/users of the networks as well.

Discriminating AI: Be Conscious about the Unconscious Bias

Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning used in the right way offer companies new and unprecedented opportunities to tap into. However, they also have a dark side.

_10-Jun-21 06:00 PM_:

and @ygg_anderson just shared this, co-written by a Kevin Werbach Professor of Legal Studies and Business Ethics and Director - it's good overview, and has some practical examples of what happened in the DeFi summer in blue boxes. I tried to map with ethical concerns, in some examples, it's almost written from the lense of fairness etc. So maybe we can use it as a starter and source more examples, to get people going in sharing their experiences or hypothetical situations in which ethical modes of reasoning would be important: [http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_DeFi_Policy_Maker_Toolkit_2021.pdf](http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_DeFi_Policy_Maker_Toolkit_2021.pdf)

The follow up question would be what to make with that knowledge? How can one lay out the results of ethical modes of reasoning? What is appropriate in a fast moving environment, in which experimentation is key; how do we handle mishaps (more interested in regenerative action, than some sort of court and punishment) [I think here we can draw from medicine, typically engineers had not been concerned with this type of environment, in which outcomes are less calculable, to get data some experimentation is necessary etc. its not that tough with building bridges]

this is super cool @ddan also something I'm really mindful of - since what Bitcoin brought about is a certain cypherpunk worldview to decentralization/distributed systems - that is fundamentally different from how P2P folks e.g. view distributed/decentralized systems --> what if you added what is fitting from that history within the different petals of the cryptoeconomic flower? --> and then have a deep link from - I guess - "Computer Science and Cryptography" to --> The History of Cryptocurrencies

_13-Jun-21 02:50 AM_:

So, in another group these "Biases" came up from a different angle: values, and principles - and of course again paradigm/worldviews

With a challenging situation ("Ethical Dilemma") we found ourselves, discussing what is known to be as "shadow"

@durgadas knows a lot more about shadow work than I for sure - but I want to connect it to a specific instance of "a day in the life of a TE"

before I put it together: here are a few excerpts from literature we can relate to:

![https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/810180622634844202/853527768494768148/a7145cd7-5a0f-4f3e-a553-226857333ae1.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/810180622634844202/853527768494768148/a7145cd7-5a0f-4f3e-a553-226857333ae1.png)

"some Jungians maintain that "the shadow contains, besides the personal shadow, the shadow of society...fed by the neglected and repressed collective values."

<img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f479.png" width=50 height=50>

1

"the shadow, in being instinctive and irrational, is prone to psychological projection, in which a perceived personal inferiority is recognized as a perceived moral deficiency in someone else"

<img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f4af.png" width=50 height=50>

1

especially the latter excerpt can be somewhat useful in pinpointing Biases and Unconcious Biases

my hope is that in TE work these issues are much easier/more structured to handle than personal "Shadow Work"

_13-Jun-21 03:00 AM_:

but drawing from these schema can help TEs practically to become "conscious about the Unconscious Biases" - also how to transcend the "objective-subjective dichatomy" we know is at the heart of token engineering, defining what is value, programming values in a multi-stakeholder multi-aspect situation:

from the Ecosystem Value Flows course:

![https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/810180622634844202/853529315622387742/unknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/810180622634844202/853529315622387742/unknown.png)

behind "lenses" are the ethical modes of reasoning I guess

assumptions depending on how they are formed are the biases, conscious - or unconcious

assumptions make up the (token) model

(the first cohort it said "After 4 days" hahah - I think any subsequent ones are entire curricula spanning at least on semester

Just went through the first meeting. A lot of interesting points definitely and take home messages on intrinsic motivations and engineering motivations. Personally, token engineering is in a way exercising our rights (rather responsibility) as intelligent species to enact social engineering. Essentially, modifying our environment that we operate/live in. Comfort and quality of life could be the general indicators of its KPI per token held.

_15-Jun-21 09:01 AM_:

interesting, the way you put it - "social engineering" looses its purely negative connotation (for me) - in "principal" I'm against "nudging" (where does manipulation, or coercion start?) - "exercising our rights/responsibility as intelligent species" is the notion of agency that is needed to get the positive view. Yet, let's also be aware "intelligent species" as you do points to our response-ability..

just wanted to share this: " If something is ugly, say so. If it is tacky, inappropriate, out of proportion, unsustainable, morally degrading, ecologically impoverishing, or humanly demeaning, don‚Äôt let it pass. Don‚Äôt be stopped by the ‚Äúif you can‚Äôt define it and measure it, I don‚Äôt have to pay attention to it‚Äù ploy. No one can precisely define or measure justice, democracy, security, freedom, truth, or love. No one can precisely define or measure any value. But if no one speaks up for them, if systems aren‚Äôt designed to produce them, if we don‚Äôt speak about them and point toward their presence or absence, they will cease to exist."

anyone else having come collections in mind? A lot of the things are on Ethical AI - which is partially comparable only - biases introduced in AI are better traceable on one hand, e.g. training logic and data provided ; and equally worse: e.g. we just don't know what the AI will have learnt - this is similar as we do not know what are the implications/unintended consquences of our "interventions" (incentive mechanism defined) in a complex adaptive system created by humans applying their own logis to interact with the system --> however we have more ways to question/understand the participant's biases & preferences, as opposed to AI/ML - however, human brain is a black box as one can get, not just AI is.

[exploratory phase doc] As of 09/06/2021 Agenda & Notes of Working Group 0mega Biweekly Wednesdays 20:00 CET, in 0mega Voice Channel Short Description The Working Group 0mega started with a rather big question of ‚ÄúHow can we enable Token Engineering Ethos to emerge from such diverse backgro...

@ all, please check the Short Description of WG as well/again: I merged with the one we continued editing in the Manifesto (removed references to "inspirations" - as we do want to keep it "data before framework", "people before processes" - I did keep ref to Integral Theory, as we do strive for cohesion accepting many worldviews will co-exist in our pratical day-to-day as Token Engineers, yet it is not an "unsatisfying" it depends, or pluralist stage we're at - at the very least we want to strive for contextual ethics / TE Ethos that nurtures Diversity

we can take time and discuss in the beginning - also if you have other points / perspectives that may be missing

_23-Jun-21 11:45 AM_:

not for now - since we are just bootstrapping; we kept google docs for now, the (tech-)sensible way would be to do it on TEC gitbook/github repo etc - that is open - but not inclusive of the ones that aren't familiar with git; likewise any tools that would be used by academics might again bias towards one view... to keep migration open we could go to Notion, which is easy for collab as well as exporting to .md files later on...

so for now focus on bootstrapping and inclusion then couple with the tooling/interfaces that are most likely to allow decentralized, tokenized curation --> the goal isn't to have Library of Babel (which is very easy with our many disciplines

) but start a curated hub that makes it easy for people to grasp the cross-pollination of the many disciplines that make the foundation of cryptoeconomics, hence, token engineering...

_24-Jun-21 04:30 AM_:

hahah I realize my answer went off on a tangencial - but it's an important point you bring in... and it relates to Ethics.. and also a point that @rodbot2 brought in... when there is a bull run... lots of people who have no idea about (crypto)markets flood in, and they are the first to bleed out. They loose everything. How can we reason about the trade off of trying new things (e.g. new auction styles) experimenting adding to collective knowledge through data & insights, permissionless ("fair") token launches e.g. through liquidity pools, which also make it super easy for scammers to create copytokens etc. and scam the n00bs who don't know how to check origins of a token contract etc...

_24-Jun-21 05:37 AM_:

Hmmmh... so these are two aspects (or many more, let's see) under the question "Who owns TE Ethics?" "Token Engineers" (Who are they anyways?) and "Participants" (can be anyone with zero knowledge on anything) - but sound decision making, ethical decision making cannot be something that is left to the hands of "high priests"; although there can be a boundary, e.g. someone actively designing/developing/improving token model (considering all socio-technical aspects of token engineering); as well as the Participants who choose to participate, and hence give legitimacy to that design.

what I have more difficulties with is making sense of the "marketing function", e.g. getting/expecting rewards (now or later) to tweeting etc. thereby increasing the number of people who potentially "buy in", e.g. early supporters increase their gain if more poeple buy in (which is a very grey zone between, "of course early adopters deserve this, they believed in the cause when no one else saw it's potential" to "multi-level marketing" (which I think is sound in an entirely decentralized network) to "ponzi scheme" )

the execution function, and the finance function, for sure the work function have been sufficiently decentralized and can be reasoned about

- somewhat sound, it depends on intrinsic value - and value-add of each marketing action

Anyways, I really like the "Phases" and "Functions" reasoning for mapping the ethical decisin making action (and consequences) space

@durgadas @solsista agreed! Worth the 10 minutes and then some. In our Sprint retrospective today we talked about the decision space as something we can bring more clarity around and this framework is, I think, a solid way to look at the order of actions to take depending on the category of what is to be solved. When we can fit the data to a pre-existing framework or when sense making of the data should preceed the framework. Great and timely share!

[Main question is about funding bit: should we include a detailed budget? Which grant/value flow is this $ coming from/to? Let's say we're a group of 5 curators working 10-12hours/month on this for 3 months at 40-50$/h?](about:blank#)

good questions

<img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f642.png" width=50 height=50>

Let's put it on the agenda this week. An idea that came to mind is that we might want the funding for

**tooling and maintenance**

of this for sure; more than for curation - as the curation should come from people who are deep in this and could spin/share their views in a heart beat,

**if < enter all what is needed to get them enrolled and efforts and funds for that, e.g. coordination, communication, organization, design, reachout, re/presentation />**

we might also organize a dedicated session with people who work on knowledge graphs etc. some over at the otherinternet do

Goal setting

Goal setting involves the development of an action plan designed in order to motivate and guide a person or group toward a goal. Goals are more deliberate than desires and momentary intentions. Therefore, setting goals means that a person has committed thought, emotion, and behavior towards attaining the goal. In doing so, the goal setter has es...

Motivation

Motivation is what explains why people or animals initiate, continue or terminate a certain behavior at a particular time. Motivational states are commonly understood as forces acting within the agent that create a disposition to engage in goal-directed behavior. It is often held that different mental states compete with each other and that only...

in all of this it's like breath of fresh air, to read into epistemology and cognitive science of Steiner h/t @sbilbao

there are two things I'd like to structure for next week's working group (a) a field test of applying "Invisible Economy" to our Initiatives (this would be super helpful also for Invisible Economy, as we'd have a second domain beyond art to test it with: knowledge commons (b) Motivations & Ethics, in which we explore the relations of these - will make sure to structure the input everyone has given to TE Ethics/Ethical considerations, such that we can view them from the lense of motivations

_14-Jul-21 02:37 AM_:

from one of their papers - very insightful

"Thus, complexity thinking emphasizes processes over static objects, relations over isolated elements, context-dependence over universality, flow over equilibrium, and wholes over parts."

"A classical illustration of the principle of suboptimization is the prisoner‚Äôs dilemma (Axelrod 1984), where the best option for one individual is the worst for the other, while the optimal, cooperative solution for both individuals is not achieved because the temptation to selfishly defect is too high. A similar ethical conundrum is the ‚Äúfree-rider‚Äù problem: for an individual it is best to profit from a collective arrangement such as the public transport system by not paying. However, if everyone would behave like that, the collective system would collapse, and everyone would suffer. Thus, the task of ethics could be defined as the formulation of rules, guidelines, and control mechanisms that reconcile the values of the whole and its different parts, so that all components work together synergetically, rather than being in conflict or opposition."

context-dependece is emphasized ~ contextual ethics

ok

but

I'd still lack the faculties "who/how to decide" in a given context , hence ethical individualism

"somewhat" makes sense for me

currently trespassing also psychology ("The Evolving Self", "Games we Play"), these all share a similar tune tha was also in "Origin of Wealth" (Complexity Economics): the evolutionary algorithm

letting my techie free, and a bit frustrated (nearing cynic) conclusion

*atm*

is: work on the algorithms, it's the only fruitful work I can offer - and hope people work on themselves, the inner work (incl. me) and be able to catch up, else the only hope remaining is "The Benevolent Algorithm"

_16-Jul-21 06:20 AM_:

interesting developments! after @durgadas mentioned it in A Hitchhiker's Guide to Token Engineering, I did read through the strongest signals (might still be patchy, as I did not involve in the whole process that unfolded - but it seems it's the manifestation of the initially identified risk - in the very beginning before WGs even started - that lead to creating of this working group) [https://forum.tecommons.org/t/open-farewell-letter/483/11?u=solsista](https://forum.tecommons.org/t/open-farewell-letter/483/11?u=solsista)

Open farewell letter

Dear Sam, TEC is the ‚Äúfirst field trial of Commons Stack‚Äù. Token Engineering Community celebrates insights - as such we should celebrate the strong signals this process is generating. For this to work TEC should have a revolving door: voice & exit, is the strongest signal a caring community member can contribute. But we could not nurture the exp...

as @sem(üå∏,üêù) mentions similar situation came up in 1Hive, and @Letty mentioned yesterday similar situation happened in TheLAO

that makes it a valuable "situation" to analyze

putting on agenda for next time: can we "stilyze" the situation, and make case study for focus group

some of us are also active in the Legitimacy task force of COALA, so we could generate very useful insights moving forward

How much HNY do the devs have in total? It's at least 30%

i dont quite get why this should be a problem the developers which know the whole project the best and invested their time into it while HNY had zero value are for sure the most capable people to decide where the road might lead us. Also the constant contributors to the project have more HNY but they really deserve to have a bigger voice then ...

with "stylizing" I mean to capture the confliction points - that should be easier done if we have the issues in the same/similar situation in TheLAO, 1Hive --> so certainly this is a special focus group... The first thing we would need to come up with "how to structure the case/focus group discussions and facilitate" such that insight can be gained... (edited)

that will be helpful for structure/facilitation of focus groups on TE Ethics as well...

a quick summary of what we can deepen asynchronously until next time

- summarize the "a lifecycle in the token economy" focus group with today's inputs
- explain cynefin " based on true stories from token projects"

I think it'll be a fun teaser for the focuse group on "decision-making frameworks"

- define the "focus groups topics/sessions, who is it for," and other coordination details, so we get this to interested parties and get participatory research on TE Ethics & Ethos kickstarted

!praise @Mount Manu for actively enriching the agenda for our next session on 18th

_05-Aug-21 04:45 AM_:

as mentioned there are more and more connecting these dots about structured defining or supporting/undermining our ethical decision making faculties: [https://alixtrot.medium.com/agile-ethics-managing-ethical-complexity-in-technology-63131f7bab95](https://alixtrot.medium.com/agile-ethics-managing-ethical-complexity-in-technology-63131f7bab95)

Agile Ethics: Managing Ethical Complexity in Technology

How can teams effectively manage the ethical complexity of technology production?

![https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*E2I1ieUhRvrKuxNfi6xKVA.png](https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*E2I1ieUhRvrKuxNfi6xKVA.png)

there's more - but always aimed at how to make this accessible in a traditional company - at least the author above points out that there shouldn't be an "ethics department" overseeing others work but actually helping decision makers build those ethical faculties - which is a huge difference in agency

_05-Aug-21 04:54 AM_:

with an uneasy feeling I must admit that this is relevant: [https://www.armyupress.army.mil/Portals/7/military-review/Archives/English/MilitaryReview_20141031_art013.pdf](https://www.armyupress.army.mil/Portals/7/military-review/Archives/English/MilitaryReview_20141031_art013.pdf) - BUT! I do not know yet if as a counter example. Since war, like colonizers game, is based on assumptions that do not hold for TE I'm assuming, specificall based on finite games, with winning and domination etc. vs. TE being more of an infinite game with composability, permissionless

etc.

HOWEVER, let's face it DeFi is entirely finite games atm

projets like Gitcoin and TEC are just starting on the path of infinite games with token networks

we haven't seen many moves yet

finite gamers of old world colonizing cryptoart etc. so nope we have not a positive example of the decentralization ideal

yet

"‚ÄúPeople overestimate their willpower, objectivity, and ability to compartmentalize‚Äù" [https://cryptoeconomicsystems.pubpub.org/pub/dupont-ethical-principles/release/13?readingCollection=c65922bd](https://cryptoeconomicsystems.pubpub.org/pub/dupont-ethical-principles/release/13?readingCollection=c65922bd) although I do not think this is severe, rampant etc. a token engineers position / views must be impartial, or egalitarian as any other participant... initial thoughts that come to mind... but you'll see that we have much more practical and relevant issues put on the table/miro board by the focus group yesterday. Yet those maybe correlated with this sentence that in the linked resource only views financial conflict of interest

"Conflicts of interest are a common and normal part of research.[...]This has resulted in a measurable bias towards pro-industry conclusions, as well as the withholding of data and delay of publication...[...]despite growing industry influence, biomedical research‚Äîand research more generally‚Äîhas increasingly moved away from prohibition of financial conflicts of interest and instead moved towards risk-based models that manage conflicts of interest through disclosure."

_18-Sep-21 09:02 AM_:

The Cypherpunks were terrified of surveillance. They envisaged the combination of cryptography and computer technology fundamentally altering the nature of trust and reputation. Now, not just on chain transactions but every move of participants in blockchain communities is being tracked. Reputation in blockchain systems could become the new algorithmic authoritarianism. Are ‚ÄòDecentralised Autonomous Organisation‚Äôs the next social credit panopticon of algorithmic governance or a different panacea, and what does this mean for human autonomy in ‚Äúautonomous‚Äù systems?

_20-Sep-21 05:21 AM_:

thank you for sharing this @Mert Ozd as one of the first things that was mentioned in the focus group: preserving privacy whilst designing measures for "fair" distribution of tokens as well as "sybil" resistance

this wednesday we're hosting a session to analyze what was mentioned in the first focus group. Quinn who is doing research on ethical cryptocurrency research will be joining us: [https://cryptoeconomicsystems.pubpub.org/pub/dupont-ethical-principles/release/13?readingCollection=c65922bd](https://cryptoeconomicsystems.pubpub.org/pub/dupont-ethical-principles/release/13?readingCollection=c65922bd)

when I read his work, some insights emerged: with only my crypto hat on, it seems unethical to excpect a participant to stay out of the game they designed; also it's the ethos of crypto: "skin in the game" , Taleb would agree

<img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f609.png" width=50 height=50>

I'm motivated to get something practical into the hands of aspiring token engineers and participants of token economies - as simple as possible but no simpler, supporting the ethic of experimentation - but also the ethic of "self-sovereignty"... in the wild wild west environment of "aping," "rug pulls" and demands of being "made whole."

this standardised ISO approach feels rather dead to me. I think we need a lot of talking with humans of flesh and blood in the process. Which makes me question whether a universal protocol makes sense at all. I like the Critical Systems Heuristics approach because it supports ongoing conversation and inquiry

_22-Sep-21 12:09 PM_:

OK here's a better reference:

1. Sources of Motivation Who is (ought to be) the client? That is, whose interests are (should be) served? What is (ought to be) the purpose? That is, what are (should be) the consequences? What is (ought to be) the measure of improvement? That is, how can (should) we determine that the consequences, taken together, constitute an improvement? 2. Sources of Power Who is (ought to be) the decision-maker? That is, who is (should be) in a position to change the measure of improvement? What resources are (ought to be) controlled by the decision-maker? That is, what conditions of success can (should) those involved control? What conditions are (ought to be) part of the decision environment? That is, what conditions can (should) the decision-maker not control (e.g. from the viewpoint of those not involved)? 3. Sources of Knowledge Who is (ought to be) considered a professional? That is, who is (should be) involved as an expert, e.g. as a researcher, planner or consultant? What expertise is (ought to be) consulted? That is, what counts (should count) as relevant knowledge? What or who is (ought to be) assumed to be the guarantor of success? That is, where do (should) those involved seek some guarantee that improvement will be achieved - for example, consensus among experts, the involvement of stakeholders, the experience and intuition of those involved, political support?

4. Sources of Legitimation Who is (ought to be) witness to the interests of those affected but not involved? That is, who is (should be) treated as a legitimate stakeholder, and who argues (should argue) the case of those stakeholders who cannot speak for themselves, including future generations and non-human nature? What secures (ought to secure) the emancipation of those affected from the premises and promises of those involved? That is, where does (should) legitimacy lie? What worldview is (ought to be) determining? That is, what different visions of `improvement‚Äô are (ought to be) considered, and how are they (should they be) reconciled? Source: Ulrich, W. (2000).

noted, will include in our list of models we want to play with to see wether and how they allow "wiggle room" for agency, this souds like it does, especially if we make it into a game: please say, you'll lead such a session :)) I'm sure I am and others would be happy to help prep. I also want to challenge points 7.-9. though: "Sources of Knowledge" especially those that are listed get a big NO from me, maybe because I see them as the main causes of why our current systems came to suck so badly. So would love to start by maybe leaving those parts "out", and have them emerge. One pattern I see is: generative epistemology; through multilogue we make sense and create knowledge...

or better yet The Consilience Project is the experiment/hypothesis, when it comes to how do we "source knowledge" in token economies

Hello guys,

I wrote a little reflection writing to TEC Library project.

the worldview I came from: "People who are raised in the industrial world and who get enthused about systems thinking are likely to make a terrible mistake. They are likely to assume that here, in systems analysis, in interconnection and complication, in the power of the computer, here at last, is the key to prediction and control. This mistake is likely because the mindset of the industrial world assumes that there is a key to prediction and control."

_29-Sep-21 01:23 PM_:

Hey! Thanks for investing time on organising your thoughts and giving feedback on the "library project".

Indeed, this is an inspiring project with ripples in management systems, systems theory and complex science as well as with the nascent field of token engineering.

Although Derrida and Foucault have given relevant contributions to several schools of thought, our ethics or overarching ontology at this point is not so much to "deconstruct" knowledge but to integrally construct or provide "better" avenues to navigate meta-frameworks.

The field of TE is really one fractal of this whole taxonomy of inter-disciplinarity in the current techno framework so it may well be one leg upon which to build a contextualized common library.

_29-Sep-21 02:00 PM_:

Oh, I see. Then maybe I can clarify some of my position here. I am actually not Foucaltian nor deconstructivist. However, I believe the insights about power and knowledge from them are valuable to create a "better" ethical society which they even do not believe such thing. For example, in the era of scientific racism, there were very prestigious research centers that continuously working on classifying races, etc. They were heavily founded by the racist regime as they benefitted and justify their acts through them. Here, we can see how power shape what to study. On top of that, also, by different institutional mechanism, they imply those "knowledge" to socially control the thoughts of people. However, there were also counter paradigms that were working to invalidate those racist theories. Without challenging those power structures this very counter paradigm can not be successful to construct ethical theory.

In our context, for example, there is a lot of research trying to glorify the concept of homoeconomicus. However, as we know people can live by cooperation without complete selfishness. To spread this knowledge one has to deal with the established paradigm of homoeconomicus.

Biopower (or biopouvoir in French) is a term coined by French scholar, philosopher, historian, and social theorist Michel Foucault.

Necropolitics

Necropolitics is the use of social and political power to dictate how some people may live and how some must die. Achille Mbembe, author of On the Postcolony, was the first scholar to explore the term in depth in his 2003 article, and later, his 2019 book of the same name.Necropolitics is often discussed as an extension of biopower, the Foucauld...

_29-Sep-21 04:16 PM_:

You seem like someone I could talk to on a human level. Everything you've said made sense/ resonated to me. I didn't go to college and barely graduated highschool but I can follow literature that influences delcolonization work. It's my jam. There are levels of social maturation that span a lifetime. "Adult" has label energy to me with a dash of ego. I believe there's being oblivious to power dynamics and being vulnerable to them. (Being raised colorblind is an example or being born into a cult blindly following traditions held) There's being aware of power dynamics and learning how to operate within them (masking/ power play for safety/ potentially resulting in internalized ableism and/or any other flavor of oppression) Then there's a level I'm noticing where I realize that acknowledging oppression is at play due to a power dynamic and choosing to act within it (following the current social protocols) is the enabling part. Kind of pulling the same threads as when I imagine folx trying to design or implement safe spaces or diversity inclusion. There are so many biases and tropes which have bled into activism that at this point everyone just assumes what people need but folx dont slow down and ask the people. Consent. Communication. I'm having a difficult time finding people who are willing to take a peek at the ways we have all been conditioned by the environments we've grown into. That may have been a hot mess I had no plan for my thoughts. They may read as bullets more so than any story?

- but then people wanting to escape the strangeloop via their more confortable path are somehow drawn back... maybe becuase the complexity of it is so experiential, immediate in the cryptospace? incl. the undeniable interlock of hardware, software, wetware

we could adapt: intention (how you got yourself into) - situation (the dilemma) - discussion (deeper level focus groups summary?) - example (tricky, but if we want to normalize openness about ethical issues, and they are handled transparently we need an NVC for giving examples, maybe @Juankbell @durgadas have insights from gravity here too) - check list (certain things to do in this situation) - rule of thumbs (deal with remaining uncertainty)

... the things that can be embedded into a token economy design - practically - are a much tinier subset

it's more like that the socio-political/-economical part of token economies is just a giant open experiment transcending cultures and nation states and any other insititutions we knew....

so the ethical economics part of it shouldn't escape into philosophy... but more like this :

_12-Oct-21 05:37 PM_:

"The alarming fact is that any realization of depth carries a terrible burden: Those who are allowed to see are simultaneously saddled with the obligation to communicate that vision in no uncertain terms: that is the bargain. You were allowed to see the truth under the agreement that you would communicate it to others (that is the ultimate meaning of the bodhisattva vow). And therefore, if you have seen, you simply must speak out. Speak out with compassion, or speak out with angry wisdom, or speak out with skillful means, but speak out you must." ‚ÄîKen Wilber

!praise @Mount Manu for sharing a new model with us that we may be able to use to quantify the intangible values that make a token economy flourish through the flourishing of its participants. Manu made a great overview presentation, explaining the "Capabilities Approach", so we could pick up on many things that resonated so we can contextualize it in Token Engineering. Since it's a quant model, this gives 0mega and TECLab working groups to collaborate!

I forgot to do this last week! But I really need to !praise @Letty @Mert Ozd @durgadas for an impromptu working sess for how to make sense of the potential we have here in 0mega and how to pin it down into practical aspects for token engineers and participants in token economies

next week we'll have @durgadas presenting "Cynefin" framework, I bet it will be synthesized with other frameworks on the go by our super collector of mental models

This is one offer, and I believe it can branch out deeper even we'll see

We decided to make 2 consequitive sessions (1) Intro to Mental Models [and what will I gain if I apply them looking at a typical experience I had/have in TE, participating in a token economy] (2) Analyzing a synthesized Model [how do I synthesize and contextualize multiple models for orientation] (see summary in tha agenda above) (edited)

Next week I'd like to present fab4rel8, with the intention to how a session should be designed (flow, interactive parts) <-- I'm thinking entirely interactive / game, RPG-style but would really need sparring there - yet it probably won't take use long 30-40 mins?

So next weeks we should also have an update on coordination/scheduling/funding proposal 20 mins

_27-Oct-21 05:47 AM_:
thank you! are you coming today? what we could do, is have these WG sparring sessions continue in parallel, as models ppl want to take apart and contextualize come along; and have scheduled sessions for the wider community with appropriate reach and invitations etc - we definitely need the scheduling/communication task taken on by someone who enjoys and is capable to run with it, now the content is clear

<img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f609.png" width=50 height=50>

- clearer

So for today's sparring on practical decision making frameworks I'm bringing: the 4 assumptions we fabulate, and 8 worldviews

Kopie von Governance_MoralPhilosophy

Now we humans are used to thinking about life as a drama of decision-making. What will be the meaning of human life, when most decisions are taken by algorithms? Yuval Harari, January 2020 Davos ‚ÄúWe are facing philosophical bankruptcy.‚Äù So, who decides who decides?

copy-pasted some content before it just for your enjoyment, but look forward to your views and insights

what I would like to test with you, is, if in an interactive manner this fab4rel8 can be a "warm up game" to inspect and appreciate different worldviews (of which in a global token economy there will always be many, and clashing even, or worldviews that run past each other without even making a noise but still causing consensus to break - the last one is really something)

as a test case we could take the story that @ygg_anderson contributed in our 1st focus group: "saving forests from the logging industry of which the revenues pay for people's rents" (paraphrasing)

and we had this on our miro:

[thank you! are you coming today? what we could do, is have these WG sparring sessions continue in parallel, as models ppl want to take apart and contextualize come along; and have scheduled sessions for the wider community with appropriate reach and invitations etc - we definitely need the scheduling/communication task taken on by someone who enjoys and is capable to run with it, now the content is clear](about:blank#)

so open question (eager to hear some views) - which worldview(s) would even attempt to synthesize and contextualize models for token engineering, ethical decision making? and which worldview(s) wouldn't or couldn't even?

e.g. principles formulated as actions "acknowledge the different worldviews and capabilities of participants"; "reflect on the dynamic landscape"; "enable informed participation" (the first two inspired by the 3 sessions we had; latter coming from Ethics of Experimentation [https://www.encyclopedia.com/social-sciences/applied-and-social-sciences-magazines/ethics-experimentation)](https://www.encyclopedia.com/social-sciences/applied-and-social-sciences-magazines/ethics-experimentation)) (edited)

just as example and then next level is what are the requirements to be able to do so: at which we have a bunch of models to choose from or ones we keep synthesizing and experimenting with

"acknowledge" doesn't cut it ... more like "host" the different worldviews and capabilities (edited)

a pretty simple example: cryptoart as number go up / investment game (perspective of trader/investor participant) vs artists who dread having to sell and market their art directly, prefer friend(ly) collectors ( which turns out to be the reason why they would benefit from participation of other market actors)

_28-Oct-21 05:43 AM_:

@Juankbell I'm curious how this whole ethical modes of reasoning resonates with current Graviton Training, could be an addition collaboration module, because I believe once people transcend the "right or wrong" mode of ethics, they are able to detect conflicting worldviews. The way I see it though, that module would be more for any participant, i.e. not necessary to go through all modules of Graviton Training. Let's put a 15 min block on the agenda next week! Is there an overview of the modules/topics in Graviton Training you can share here as well?

This is super interesting experience :)) So by "acknowledging the mutltitude of worldviews" we open up room for ethical dilemmas [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethical_dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethical_dilemma) - because in my engineering-only worldview what I can measure has supremacy over that which cannot be quantified, and I try to make up for it with "don't be evil" (google's code back in the days when they were very well aware of the power and responsibility and were still uncorrupted by having to run a global business that is solely financed by ads)

Ethical dilemma

In philosophy, ethical dilemmas, also called ethical paradoxes or moral dilemmas, are situations in which an agent stands under two (or more) conflicting moral requirements, none of which overrides the other. A closely related definition characterizes ethical dilemmas as situations in which every available choice is wrong. The term is also used ...

now by opening up my worldview, and helping me appreciate/host other worldviews in the token economy - I am presented with ethical dilemmas

"There are different global scale social dynamics that will arise depending on whether this grammatic capacity is owned or enclosed, vs if it‚Äôs held as a commons. If the carriers on which the signals in the grammar are sent are owned, then then that creates a huge power-imbalance. Thus, the unenclosability of the fundamental carriers of the grammatic capacity makes a huge difference in what will evolve there.

^^ this is from Eric / Holochain, I'm really intrigued by the metaphors they are using - would love to have a session with them on:

"Play cannot happen inside the context of coercion. But play is also all about temporarily creating finite boundaries, and rules by which to enter into consentfull play. And this is the role of the Protocol for Protocols. "

there might be some insights we can use in establishing "multilogue on ethical dilemmas in token economies"

@durgadas, similarly to "bringing in diversity" doesn't make sense, because the nature of it already is... "unifying" doesn't make sense because the nature of it already is... would love to adapte cynefin to the subtle tune we've found here: simplify, without truncating by finding the grain(s) of truth; when moving from the chaotic (pray and act ?!

It's interesting that he mentions "though truth is universal, there is always a local aspect in its expression." This aligns with my point of view for religion in that they aren't meant for the collective to strictly abide by, but rather to guide individual experiences. While the universal truth can be shared through words on a page, or rituals, it is the individual's intrinsic motivation to study it and apply it that helps the truth be understood and conveyed better.

So, I just skimmed the doc that @Mount Manu linked in the agenda - I would love to play the "worldviews game" on those notions of leadership! As some of it I can clearly see is rooted in a "command and control" worldview. Massive global coordination that doesn't end up in mass manipulation requires "self-leadership" or at least the flexibility of leader-follower, student-teacher... kind of the eye to see the charisma in each one of us...

right! I wrote something like this in my notes the other day ^ If we judge anything, ourselves or the external with the perspective of A, within a limited time frame, we may think that it has gotten worse, but really we are just in a state of becoming. Each dip is representative of the monsters we must learn to bring into the light within a hero's journey. They are eventually overcome, but if we continue to look through the perspective of A, we may think they can never be overcome. Not everyone thinks this way though. Some aren't even aware that they have a choice not to accept that which is presented to them. I sometimes lost this awareness!

[So, I just skimmed the doc that @Mount Manu linked in the agenda - I would love to play the "worldviews game" on those notions of leadership! As some of it I can clearly see is rooted in a "command and control" worldview. Massive global coordination that doesn't end up in mass manipulation requires "self-leadership" or at least the flexibility of leader-follower, student-teacher... kind of the eye to see the charisma in each one of us...](about:blank#)

it may be leadership to be willing to be vulnerable for a person who is generally closed

it may be leadership to be angry when faced with injustice, but hopefully this will not be its final form

I. Tide Pools When the ebbing tide retreats Along the rocky shoreline It leaves a trail of tidal pools In a short-lived galaxy Each microcosmic planet A complete society A simple kind mirror To reflect upon our own All the busy little creatures Chasing out their destinies Living in their pools They soon forget about the sea‚Ä¶ Wheels within wheels In a spiral array A pattern so grand And complex Time after time We lose sight of the way Our causes can‚Äôt see Their effects

in the TEC. How can we share the knowledge currently gathered by the omega so that members who came here to learn can start learning? Should they just start joining omega calls and say "I need help with this"? What if they don't even know what to ask, or aren't even aware that what is talked about in omega is something they should definitely be learning about if they're interested in ethical token economies?

my point with the poetic turn was to show that, in this instance, when the tide retreats (Bitcoin or TEC tokens go down, say) people's needs change and the little pool they find themselves in changes in context or cut off from others in some way that previously made it possible to move between those areas

there can be many other causes- in my case, I'm too busy to be as engaged as I'd like, so I have no way to get across to some of the other areas and learn about them

[right! I wrote something like this in my notes the other day ^ If we judge anything, ourselves or the external with the perspective of A, within a limited time frame, we may think that it has gotten worse, but really we are just in a state of becoming. Each dip is representative of the monsters we must learn to bring into the light within a hero's journey. They are eventually overcome, but if we continue to look through the perspective of A, we may think they can never be overcome. Not everyone thinks this way though. Some aren't even aware that they have a choice not to accept that which is presented to them. I sometimes lost this awareness!](about:blank#)

***In the depth of your hopes and desires lies your silent knowledge of the beyond; And like seeds dreaming beneath the snow your heart dreams of spring. Trust the dreams, for in them is hidden the gate to eternity.*** ^speaks to no longer being embedded in the coral reef and to let go of the old self that would be swayed by the waves. The death of the old self leads to rebirth - the phoenix moment. I love this song too ‚Äî Waves by Bahamas. Here are some parts: ‚ÄúAnd I held the breath inside my lungs for days And I saw myself as one of many waves And when I knew I'd become the ocean's slave I just stayed And we carried far with all the waters past Of the waves I was not first I was not last And if we saw a boat afloat we took the mast So fast‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd before too long the waves grew out of hand And they worked to keep the sea at their command And the only thing they feared it seemed the sand And dry land‚Äù ‚ÄúFrom the water there was born a bright blue roar As it rolled and formed and calmed the ocean's floor And it finally rose and broke upon the shore No more‚Äù

In yoga we talk about the breath and prana A LOT, so there is a bunch I'm leaving out here, but these aspects of prana speak to our motivations, and since the pranic part of the koshas is paired with the thinking mind and wisdom, paying attention to that can open up deeper aspects of thinking and wisdom to your consciousness

That song actually is a beautiful meditation on those precise things, too, if you look at the lyrics

I can see the connections there pretty clearly, so that's really something

Apparently the brain pays attention to the breath as well to detect whether it‚Äôs in danger or not. It‚Äôs why it‚Äôs taught to people with anxieties to control their breath first so that the mind does not start the fight or flight response.

There is a trick I use to make people aware of their breath during teacher trainings

You make them REALLY listen for a certain number of claps with their eyes closed, and watch who invests themselves in the game

and then watch their breath as you are doing it

_06-Nov-21 04:40 PM_:

but people are not aware of the various conditions under which their breath is involved

so I use it as a way to bring their awareness to this

Yoga is, at the gross/beginning part, about gradually moving the awareness, breath and movement together.

At first, they are apart

I have a similar methodology when I'm approaching topics with the TEC. It is a process, so being consistent and persistent is required

as well as having a very subtle grasp of the inner and outer life of yourself and others

Awareness for the TEC side is this light/shadow approach I talk about a lot. Breath is the actual work of it, the ebb and flow- the restless tide so to speak, and the movement is the intention behind.

if you watch, you can see me trying to make this combined approach ignite within each group and individual- all of these combine for some second order effects- like giving themselves permission to do a complicated or a complex thing, and to Know Things Are Possible and my emphasis on Contextualization is to pull people forward with a kind of knowledge that makes it seem like there is no roof on your ability to grow and discover

I feel like this aligns with what we were talking about. It‚Äôs funny I picked this book up on a whim when I couldn‚Äôt find the book I was looking for.

Self-inquiry does not say "Be aware of your breath" but rather "Who is breathing?" or "Who is really alive?". It does not say "Be mindful of your body" but rather asks "Are you the body?". Self-inquiry is not a form of passive or choiceless awareness, but has a dynamic and probing energy. It questions the validity of the entity who thinks that he is aware. It does not accept our awareness as it is but asks "Who is aware?" "What is the nature of this awareness?". Self-inquiry uses the energy of observation but as a tool of questioning, ever taking it to a deeper level of examination. It is questioning the reality of the entity that we think is either good or bad, that can either improve or degenerate. It questions our efforts to be this or that and says that without knowing ourselves it is of no lasting benefit to try to become anything, however great or noble. Similarly, Self-inquiry is not an attempt to make the world better or to bring love or compassion into the world. It is a questioning whether what we call the world has any reality at all, or is just a reflection of our thought process. Yet Self-inquiry brings us into contact with our true Self that is one with all. This is the basis of all compassion and real service in the world, which transcend thought and selfish motivation. While Self-inquiry leads to the absolute truth, which can be called the pure-I or Self, the name is only a pointer. One can call it God, knowledge, enlightenment, Buddha or whatever one likes, but it is not a state that can be defined according to an idea, or in which mental recognition can occur. Self-inquiry is not seeking any mental answer and has no conceptual result. It questions the validity of all entities and conclusions created by the mind.

Self-inquiry is a provocative state that directs awareness to its core in the heart. It is like a sword that cuts through everything. It does not even allow us to hold to a happy or peaceful state of consciousness short of real Self-realization. It does not allow us to rest content in the contemplation of objects, principles of ideas, however lofty these may be. In the ultimate truth the Self is the only reality. Our inquiry into it and all else that we do is merely a fiction of thought. Yet this fiction of thought is not personal but includes the entire universe. It consists of all possible types of mental activity, conscious and subconscious. The world is the great maya or illusion of the Lord (Bhagavan) that requires not only our own selfless effort but Divine grace in order to cross. Yet attempting this is the real purpose of our birth and the real goal of all our lifetimes. Let us seek our true Self with honesty and humility, and all the wonders of the universe and what is beyond must come to us.

So I believe, and it was also what @Letty left as a comment last time, this group is and shall feel empowered to be the go to place to have these inquiries - and there can be no curriculum for that. Coming into a stream of consciousness like this is really a gift

At the same time, if we want to ground these insights / contextualize and play with them; it shall be in "systems engineering" - this is the "......a branch of engineering which concentrates on the design and application of the whole as distinct from the parts, looking at a problem in its entirety, taking account of all the facets and all the variables and linking the social to the technological...."

poems, mystical writings ,... these can as you say encode many-layered knowledge on many layers

what we're doing through self-inquiry is seeing those layers

where motivation/need arises in our human experience ... and I can imagine now that there is an incorruptible place that is without motivation/need/desire

that latter place is where all decisions/actions should arise from

else it is manipulated/manipulateable - which literally is behavorial game theory; one cornerstone of cryptoeconomics

a more honest/unified way to see this may be, acknowledging that token engineering, too, is a fiction of thought - it can be helpful, or harmful

not right or wrong

it is created by humans... so technology as created in the "logical positivist" worldview is only what we can measure, what manifests - but major changes, paradigm shifts were only possible when people of more open worldviews have continued the play regardless of paradoxes

in fact this is the pattern of progress

depending on who is present and wants to dig into which initiatives, but I'd like to at least check back with TE Consilience

think we have the why and the what, and somewhat the how - when we nail that last part self-organization around those initiatives will be much easier

- TE Ethics - Ethical Principles and support system
- TE Consilience Library - a gift back to the community from those who made it alive through one or more rabbit holes

heya... I really feel the need to explore language: anti-language (e.g. poems, mystic text, koans to deal with non-duality of "dilemmas"), mathematic language (how human mind/language cannot capture what maths could [https://www.veritasium.com/videos/2021/11/1/this-problem-broke-math-and-led-to-quantum-physics)](https://www.veritasium.com/videos/2021/11/1/this-problem-broke-math-and-led-to-quantum-physics)), solidity (what are those contracts say that I interact with) (edited)

can I add this onto next week?

"We'll we have a special sensemaking session on "Finding Common Language in Token Economies". The session is 60 min, with an additional 30 mins for deepening or consiliencing the insights we generate. This plays into "Informed participation" and "Hosting multiple worldviews" ethical principles. As well as helps us develop tolerance for complexity when it comes to "Ethical Dilemmas" in token engineering design and participation in token economies.

<img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f642.png" width=50 height=50>

"accesibility and ability to access"

I'd use instead of "common language" moving forward

loved also "not a language it is a conversation" comment

and how we need create spaces - and fill them with "awareness processes" (could be a sense-making game like Glass Bead Game, Systems Being through motion, Alternative Words guide, Worlds of Worldviews game) , between "stimulus and response"

<img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f525.png" width=50 height=50>

Stimulus being any change: creation, update, forks, ...

_17-Nov-21 05:11 PM_:

I had a lovely time here today. Everything we covered is literally the beginning of the culmination of my life's work. Aloysious is intrinsically motivated by the following items: 1. We are all abused by the oppression we internalize and inflict on one another, and that our social and governmental systems inflict on us. [Opression is in our linguistics some of it is disguised as activism] Insert :Trauma informed linguistics 2. [My stats] Over 60% of the population is on the spectrum and the number will climb with procreation. [Evolution? Are we becoming more sensitive to the enviornment as an evolutionary bit for us to attune back to being in relationship with the planet before we destroy it?] 3. Because of the autism factor: people are more reactive, more liable to be taken advantage of, abused, neglected, coping through narcissistic patterns to get needs met, kidnapped, not personally held accountable for thier behavior [self soothe through calling outs] etc. Insert neuroduvirsity movement [people need to see how many people we have undiagnosed and filling filling filling up wait lists in thier 30s and 40s this trend gets bigger each year] 4. The great identity crisis: from colonialism to white supremacy rhetoric reinforced through churches, schools and the military. Shame and rape culture are the things that carry the venom of oppression. People have many identities not many people know how to embrace and love and bring forward them all...many people don't even know thier identities because their enviornments are telling them what they are. [A white person still activated by the words white person has not done the extent required of personal work in decolonization, they are still identifying with the literal white person when whiteness is an energy.. you don't Carry so much when you are grounded in your plethora of identities] just like black people dont want to be reduced to the color of thier skin...neither do white folx and we have linguistics that give us permission to talk like this. I think that's shite. Still need to use the language to illuminate the bonkers in it all. Insert: oppressive behavioral modification as a concept for people to understand. Teach people that the social norms we have all agreed to regarding power and racial dynamics are harmful and reinforced through shame practices and truly harming our children. We all want our kids to "fit in" [I personally dont] because it keeps them safe...but we are oppressing them out the gate and become the reason they don't establish consent or boundary awareness. I'm gonna skip the adults...they can tune in but I want to create an authenticity movement for the youth. I want to teach decolonization to kids I've done it with my daughter...I think this would nip social shit in the bud before people grow and learn to manipulate power dynamics. (edited)

+ I'm sure there's a few more passion projects but yeah I think it's important for me to start expressing myself. I don't expect people to buy into my thoughts and words due to social conditioning and I'm grounded in my beliefs and won't stop creating and informing and influencing the culture around me. I have no problem digging into the weeds of topics and have empathy for differences of opinions. I welcome anyone to engage with my words if ever they feel called.

we make room for TE Consilience as @Mert Ozd has worked on providing it structure in Notion, would be great to get feedback and more supporters

I'd love to pick up above questions and insights for next time, so maybe we can start with a 10-15 mins on those. I think it's relevant, and there are some news, e.g. Rewards Systems working group that's new and where we might actually dock onto for both sharing insights as well as testing out some of the "out there stuff"

some updates from Fabian, who is following and is super excited of the work, but can never make the time due to being in Asia etc.

look forward! see you in approx 30 mins in [https://discord.gg/NQuZAYKk](https://discord.gg/NQuZAYKk)

_25-Nov-21 05:07 AM_:
thanks! I also like the notion of multi-dimensional communication (e.g. moving in space, connecting through mirroring movements, what Reyna showed us last time) - it's visible when art, music, poem, dance touches something inside, when it's non-verbal or supraverbal... of course that is not what ultimately going to be encoded in smart contracts nor simualtions - but as @üêô octopus mentioned in that same sensemakign session, maths is 80% reasoning, honing intuition, 20% coming up with the mathematical formula as the result of that reasoning - which in our case is collective reasoning, and in TE more typical than not: reasoning with neurodiverse people

would love this to have space in the psychology petal

_25-Nov-21 05:11 AM_:

see the depiction above, Nic. I'd love for us here to experiment a bit more at the bold edge, trying to unify these seemingly separate things... there's a "formula" we came up with in Invisible Economy, which I believe also captures the value appreciation in this working group:

![https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/810180622634844202/913371654556614656/unknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/810180622634844202/913371654556614656/unknown.png)

now this requires to look at the actions / contributions - rather than to look at roles and reputation

it acknowledges that the highs one gets from actually surviving these cryptoeconomics rabbit hole(s) (why it's black in the middle) and coming out on the other end with actualy insights and likely a bit wiser is indeed priceless (intrinsic reward) and the extrinsic reward (e.g. share of TEC token for contributing to the TE library or the TE Ethics Principles and Practical Sessions) go hand in hand without interfering, i.e. just because one is intrinsically motivated doesn't mean the system should just extract the value created and not give back (what @stef mentioned yesterday, basically leads actual intriniscally motivated value creators like artists and scientists to live in mostly precarious levels), it also for sure doesn't mean one is going to come up with a groundbreaking insight or a piece of art because it's got a bounty of 10k of some token...(surely not)

but it also acknowledges the usefulness of useless knowledge (which *every* innovation we are using today to have this convo is created from)

My personal thought about math -- the symbols we use are just tiny pictures like this one, compressed for portability. Think of each symbol as a semiotic Lego.

Perhaps symbiotic, too. I love this quote by Heinrich Hertz:

I also think that questioning is a game the Universe likes to play with us, that curiosity is a high value. At the risk of bordering on self-promotion, there's a video I made about this that fits the theme:

ALOYSIOUS

[I had a lovely time here today. Everything we covered is literally the beginning of the culmination of my life's work. Aloysious is intrinsically motivated by the following items: 1. We are all abused by the oppression we internalize and inflict on one another, and that our social and governmental systems inflict on us. [Opression is in our linguistics some of it is disguised as activism] Insert :Trauma informed linguistics 2. [My stats] Over 60% of the population is on the spectrum and the number will climb with procreation. [Evolution? Are we becoming more sensitive to the enviornment as an evolutionary bit for us to attune back to being in relationship with the planet before we destroy it?] 3. Because of the autism factor: people are more reactive, more liable to be taken advantage of, abused, neglected, coping through narcissistic patterns to get needs met, kidnapped, not personally held accountable for thier behavior [self soothe through calling outs] etc. Insert neuroduvirsity movement [people need to see how many people we have undiagnosed and filling filling filling up wait lists in thier 30s and 40s this trend gets bigger each year] 4. The great identity crisis: from colonialism to white supremacy rhetoric reinforced through churches, schools and the military. Shame and rape culture are the things that carry the venom of oppression. People have many identities not many people know how to embrace and love and bring forward them all...many people don't even know thier identities because their enviornments are telling them what they are. [A white person still activated by the words white person has not done the extent required of personal work in decolonization, they are still identifying with the literal white person when whiteness is an energy.. you don't Carry so much when you are grounded in your plethora of identities] just like black people dont want to be reduced to the color of thier skin...neither do white folx and we have linguistics that give us permission to talk like this. I think that's shite. Still need to use the language to illuminate the bonkers in it all. Insert: oppressive behavioral modification as a concept for people to understand. Teach people that the social norms we have all agreed to regarding power and racial dynamics are harmful and reinforced through shame practices and truly harming our children. We all want our kids to "fit in" [I personally dont] because it keeps them safe...but we are oppressing them out the gate and become the reason they don't establish consent or boundary awareness. I'm gonna skip the adults...they can tune in but I want to create an authenticity movement for the youth. I want to teach decolonization to kids I've done it with my daughter...I think this would nip social shit in the bud before people grow and learn to manipulate power dynamics.

this made me reflect a lot about "identities" and the issues that pure notion causes... if we're setting out to actually get at issues at global scale, there's only one common identity that makes sense: "sentient being"... and love our pluralities and multi-dimensionality and differences.... as those make a kick-ass "ensemble model" that sees better than an "overfitted model" (some machine learning jargon, but I think the words make sense invariantly)

Sometimes it makes sense to abstract away the individual complexity (when 2 + 3 = 5 it doesn't matter if they're apples or rocks) and other times it doesn't (I would rather eat an apple than a rock, but that's a personal preference).

Upaya is often used with kaushalya (‡§ï‡•å‡§∂‡§≤‡•ç‡§Ø, "cleverness"), upaya-kaushalya meaning "skill in means"....

Hello folks,

today @solsista and I created tasks for the Library project

feel free to take a look

would it be good perhaps to do sessions on creating user personas...so we can try empathise with the people we're hoping the library would be useful for? (edited)

like this? While it puts binary labels on people..it can be useful to figure out and find cohesion in what we think their pain points and needs are, which influences the way the library is created

_01-Dec-21 06:53 PM_:

Well, when I asked this about a year ago, I was given some access to a Miro board with some information on it with some of what I was asking about. It was a lot more specialized toward whales and crypto techs in my view and I think each working group could benefit by doing their own. We‚Äôre definitely going to do one for gravity soon and comms is going to adopt it for their clients I think.

I‚Äôm still a little unclear about the audience for this library but it appears pretty general for token engineering whereas I‚Äôm a like more cultural focused

We are hacking on the library and creating content I think

It just came into existence a week ago so I‚Äôm a little more focused on some deliverables with manu that take a decent effort in and of themselves

Idea generation would be all of us sketching or showing how we‚Äôre seeing the solution in boxes and circles. By solution I mean the interface that the users will be interacting with.

It‚Äôs been my observation that it‚Äôs best to know What you‚Äôre wanting to say or do plus Who you are saying it to, so you can connect them with mapped content. Idea generation is kind of built in to that. I used to do all of it as separate processes and it just took forever

And there are built in approaches I‚Äôve learned to help flesh out all three as we go

But you are all golden to hit the road! especially with the Notion Pages for Consilience. We can always update each other in the WG meetings with a short update, so ppl know what's happening, what is needed, where to join - or a full-hour presentation on bigger milestones, e.g. when Notion pages are all set (we worked out the tasks yesterday), or when bigger works need feedback, common understanding of the group etc.

_02-Dec-21 04:38 AM_:

To make the start easier: we can start with Curators and in parallel have that co-creation and engagement: but as a practioning TE (and other will attest to it) there's just not enough time for co-creation when people are in the trenches of token projects - so starting with empathy, and actually reaching "Seed Curators" that @Mert Ozd named who are TEs and have been through the rabbit holes: In parallel it would be wonderful, if you reach out to TEs maybe @Aidan üåê‚ô® @ygg_anderson can help with input as some friendly TEs who know the rabbit holes: What is a very useful library that jumps TE knowledge together? can you support @nic and @durgadas with giving some more insights here, and maybe connect to other TEs who have a wishlist for makeing TE knowledge more accessible, digestable, in a way to shorten paths it takes to get a handle on cryptoeconomics - but also develop a deeper understanding, the philosophy if you will that is behind cryptoeconomics, deeper than the mechanics and tools

In the recording you'll at least hear what Mert and I reasoned again who this is for (and basically gave our perspectives as TE OG (relatively long around) and TE NB (relative newbie

<img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f609.png" width=50 height=50>

) both of us are active in token projects (Mert PrimeDAO) and have been through (painful and rewarding process of unconfusing ourselves and connecting the many streams according to our backgrounds: Mert background Political Science and Economics, my background Computer Science and Economics... and the rest of our synthesized knowledge is auto-didactic, mainly motivated to understand Token Engineering...

and both of us are happy to do a user interview as a starting point

@Letty is a Legal Engineer, she'd be happy to do a user interview as well

once the Manifesto and Structure/Scaffold tasks are done, and user interview questions ( @nic do you want to maybe even add a specific task for it?) are available we can blast it into our TEC, TE Academy, and TE Books channels and our networks to get more insights and engagement

It's in our Agenda document

It just picked up speed once @Mert Ozd exercised self-leadership and co-ownership :)) Let's support him, since this TE Consilience Library is definitely needed to help people gloss over the entire field of Token Engineering

The other initiative TE Ethics is pretty much self-organized, we just need the lead facilitators, co-facilitators to get together and formulate when, for whom they would love to start hosting the sessions: We have on session for each TE Ethical Principle and people who already self-selected as providers: @durgadas @Mount Manu @nic @rodbot2 @f8 et moi:

we'll support as co-faciliators at least @nic and I have committed! the entire group is happy to pick up the slack with coordination - but content needs to come from you, happy to help contextualize it into Token Engineering if there's need. (edited)

@Mert and I said yesterday, that we'll provide/update Initiative Proposal (for forum post) for the group to review, and add what is needed

and share here

_02-Dec-21 11:54 AM_:

@solsista so far I can think of 5 user personas, the budding token engineer, the current token engineer, the subject matter expert who wants to share, the person who wants to help the budding token engineer, the person who wants to help the subject matter expert share. So we can do that user persona creation exercise on miro to see what others think about who we‚Äôre helping. Then validate it afterwards with a survey, maybe even targeting new members, to see if our assumptions of their existences are true. The survey will ask them the same questions we asked ourselves. Eg what are your needs? If they answer with needs unrelated to token engineering that will give insight into their motivation for learning about token engineering. If they answer with needs relating to token engineering we can generate ideas to directly solve their problem. Then once we‚Äôve come closer to understanding them, we can do the idea generation exercise. (edited)

_02-Dec-21 12:12 PM_:

An example result would be: We learned that the environment in which a budding token engineer spends most time in is noisy due to working from home, and with family being home. Therefore the format in which the learning materials will be delivered will be mostly through small courses that can be done on their own, with a forum section where learners and subject matter experts can discuss areas in which they‚Äôre confused about. Learning through video or audio format and especially calls would not be ideal in a noisy environment. Now we know the user interface must be designed in such a way that can deliver courses and allow for conversations. Ideas of how the user interface will look will have been generated through idea generation. Once user interface is designed, we can show a prototype to the people who answered the survey to see if they would find it useful. Then we can move on to building the app itself (edited)

[An example result would be: We learned that the environment in which a budding token engineer spends most time in is noisy due to working from home, and with family being home. Therefore the format in which the learning materials will be delivered will be mostly through small courses that can be done on their own, with a forum section where learners and subject matter experts can discuss areas in which they‚Äôre confused about. Learning through video or audio format and especially calls would not be ideal in a noisy environment. Now we know the user interface must be designed in such a way that can deliver courses and allow for conversations. Ideas of how the user interface will look will have been generated through idea generation. Once user interface is designed, we can show a prototype to the people who answered the survey to see if they would find it useful. Then we can move on to building the app itself  (edited)](about:blank#)

_07-Dec-21 04:53 PM_:

We talked about our processes during the call and found that they were aligned. One way we can move forward is to continue talking between @durgadas and I so that we can create a process, but I think that we shouldn't just discuss it between ourselves and have the discussion with the group. What I was proposing is basically Lean UX Design: - creating user personas as a group - this can help inform the bounds of the library we are creating, so that it may take shape - From the user personas, we can use our assumptions of the user personas' pain points and start idea generation. Idea generation will also be done as a group. The beauty of it is everyone brings in their focus/ideas/expertise. For example, during idea generation, perhaps @durgadas can start focusing on mapping the content for the user journey based on the user pain points, while someone else figures out how the content will be grouped together, and at the same time, another person can be designing a user interface for it. - Once we've got that, we can start testing continuously. So during omega wg calls, we can determine which assumptions we will be testing, then the next two days, everyone refines what they're working on based on what is being tested. (For example, whoever is creating the content to be tested, they will edit it during these days while a designer refines the design that the group generated during idea generation, and a developer will code what the designer created. The user interviewer will be refining how they will do the interview so that they can discover more insights, or make the user feel more comfortable.) Then after that, testing actually happens. We can talk to token engineers who want to learn. Then on the next wg call, we talk about the insights gained and decide whether our hypotheses were validated and what to test next. (edited)

Eventually we will get to a point where we will feel comfortable to start introducing rewards systems and incentivising knowledge sharing and learning. This would be where cadCAD will come in and we can start testing that way. These are just my ideas though of how product design and token engineering can come together from my (limited) understanding. (edited)

_08-Dec-21 12:16 PM_:

hmm sure yeah, my ideas were too structured and not really play/exploration. (edited)

For the seeding phase, I would say the question is how might we make what the subject matter experts create, be something that delivers the knowledge towards people in different advancement of their Token Engineering journey (eg how deep in the TE rabbit hole have they gone). An example from my experience was I joined a TE Academy class/workshop but it was like watching a lecture in a different language. None of it made sense. I knew I needed to understand, but I didn't know what I needed in order to make myself understand. So when a Subject Matter Expert writes an article (or whichever format they deliver it in), I understand that it will be useful for becoming a token engineer but I don't know how to apply it as my brain is incapable of understanding at this point in time. In this case, I would recommend what @durgadas suggests during the seed phase rather than waiting until Metaprofiles phase. I believe that his suggestion was mapping the content for the user's journey to becoming a token engineering, so that we do not create a learning experience in which we have a library full of stuff and us saying "off you go! good luck! ask questions!" but they wouldn't even know what sort of questions to ask.

It's not a DAO onboarding: It's about people who want to learn about Foundations of Cryptoeconomics & Token Engineering --> TE Concilience Library

THe "Who is it for?" is super important for contextualizing our contributions

<img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f609.png" width=50 height=50>

And we emphasize how the transdisciplinarity of Token Engineering, that's why it's a curated library (not huge, but curated & annnotated by TE OGs as well as newbies)

I consider web design to be dead so I wasn't concerned with the UI/UX as that, in my mind has been templated to death

and novel UI/UX is bad for neurodiverse people

so this was a bit of a synching we had to do on the call to be sure who was concerned with what

but I did see that there was a lot of value to the other stuff and processes I saw in that meeting

A new tool for teams & individuals that blends everyday work apps into one.

I know their descriptions are not crystal clear but please ask anything in your mind, I would be very happy to help.

Also, @nic and @durgadas I was thinking that we can implement your user journey idea in"write start here" task. You can create a structure that can have a UX you like !

For TE Consilience Library: please take a tour of the tasks we figured out are needed for a first iteration (to gather experience and feedback, and to actually have a minimal transdisciplinarily curated library ; ) (edited)

I feel these are the valuable contributions we have been providing - in principle (i.e. generalized)

- sensemaking / finding direction & facilitating
- once value stock emerged (e.g. the initiatives and rough idea why we wanted/needed those, whether we are capable to make those happen) through facilitation; we have contributions of "structuring"
- then comes liquidity

<img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f609.png" width=50 height=50>

the actions that make value flow are identified (see task list for TEC lib, or table of practice sessions for TE Ethics) we want to allocate the budget
however - these first funds we get to allocate are by no means even reflective of the genius you all have been already pouring into this working group ‚ù§Ô∏è

<img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f64f.png" width=50 height=50>

it's a way of acknowledging, and getting things started - see it as "seed funding" in phases

what is possible after each structured seed has been planted into healthy soil and watered lightly, is not limited

so when you pick up a task, make sure it's priceless to you anyways

<img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f609.png" width=50 height=50>

and the rewards that TEC has potentially available to be requested for WG is an over the top extrinsic reward

don't let it mess up with your motivations to really figure out these questions of transdisiplinarity, finding unity in diversity, what it means to nurture living ethical principles *in Token Engineering*

We were a hetrogenous batch and formed a discussion group along with seniors discussing development Eco. Me, i changed my field from Engineering to Economics....

Programming in Fortran on punch cards was unmitigated hell. One would leave a stack of cards and get the output one day later as a printout. All one had to do sabotage another guys program was to change the order of one card, or just bend one. Relative grading patterned after MIT. We had a few faculty from MIT.

[thread]: Great article. But "interdependence" as defined as an "augmented indiividual" or "artisan" could always dominate ANY pure machine.

[thread]: so no - in practice to deploy a token network IRL: we need financial engineering, legal engineering and software engineering. The social part - if we'd just used our rational mind would end up in "social engineering".... unfortunately I've read this phrase somewhere even as a given recently. That has nothing to do with where Cryptoeconomics started... we still have the supremacy of self-sovereingty, which starts with self-knowledge, for participants and for engineers in the token network...

[thread]: oh so many good things to catch up on... I'll be back on Wednesday only ... really need to attend to the clean energy project that's keeping us happily busy till February, but I can't wait till Wed. wishing you all a great start of the week .. @nic please add any comments esp. re. where you see your name as co-facilitator in TE Ethics for example, we can still have an additional round... but would love to have any urgent comments clarified this Wednesday, so we can progress

_13-Dec-21 05:25 AM_:

[thread]: Methinks it goes a bit beyond "crude" social engineering. Designing a token mechanism to achieve desired generally measurable, but complex economic objectives is IMO pretty straightforward. Incentivising ethical behaviour like say "lowering the sugar content in street food sold" could be regulated by either punitive mechanisms or a rewards(negative punishment) mechanism. My hunch is every punitive measure could be better served with a parallel incentivisation mechanism along with other non monetary mechanisms in the spirit of Ostrom.

[thread]: If someone could assign specific tasks, I could take up some of them. Or do you want me to just try filling in the gaps? Prefer the former.

For the doc I mentioned, it‚Äôs interesting to think of how to flip it, they talk about using tools available to them to sabotage but what I find cool is that what‚Äôs happening at the TEC is that people are using what they know to help the TEC!

_15-Dec-21 06:14 AM_:

I care about helping direct people who want to create better systems towards the resources available currently, since from my experience it was quite daunting hunting for and digesting the resources. This is why I‚Äôm talking with Aidan from LTF, and joined the intro to Token Engineering call today to see what we can do to bring more people these important resources so that the future may be safer because what‚Äôs being built now will be safer, and regenerative. At the core of it, I wish to create a future in which people can feel safe to explore who they are, gain self knowledge and grow. There are people I know or knew who I wish could have (or have had) that ‚Äòluxury‚Äô. I truly believe if individuals had that, that we‚Äôd be a stronger, more diverse and enriched collective.

yes but TEC is like an ashram compared to the casino of Sushiswap

<img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f61b.png" width=50 height=50>

ppl behave differently in different environments - or avoid those environments that have nothing to offer for them... so that's why TEC feels different - now an interesting tought experiment is what if the ABC kept and kept raising so much funds for self-knowledge and knowledge sharing in TE as public goods that it became an ashramcasino? Do we have everything in place we need to nurture the TEC culture?

another thing that is important for Reward System is to think about, each one of us, **what it is that we need to devote more time** into TE self-knowledge (locate oneself in the complex plane that TE/TEC as organisation as well as a transdiciplinary domain ~ intention) and TE knowledge curation/processing and sharing (in whatever form, we chose 2 initiatives for and keeping the 0mega up) as public good

for some it is structure, showing where input/contributions needed, for others it is to top up the incoming material valueflows to carve out more time from their day job, or have extended break outs from "commissioned work" ot break into the depths of TE knowledge discovery, etc. etc. yet for other it's just knowing that this place continues to exist

_15-Dec-21 06:28 AM_:

It would be cool to apply TE process to building the omega, eg motivations and incentives, creating value flows, simulating and then encoding it in smart contract since eventually (unless I‚Äôm misunderstanding) we want this to be curated by the people using it

I will doing work for omega outside of work hours so will likely by a couple hours a day, I could help anywhere really. Eg if you want me to support a facilitator creating content for a specific topic, maybe I can make it easier to understand for someone non technical. Maybe I can find ways to make this learning experience easier in general for someone non technical (Hence my suggestion to do the user persona stuff). Maybe you just need someone to check up on the people writing articles (more like project management), maybe you need someone to make an app that can be attached to the TEC website for this library.

_15-Dec-21 06:32 AM_:

yes! I would keep it simple for these first initiatives and the first round of funding proposals - just to keep momentum, it's all good. However, it would be fantastic if we can use our WG 0mega sessions to actuall do that, I made a comment based on @ALOYSIOUS and @Letty 's comments in TE Ethics, that we have an underlying current of both initiatives, which has become the tagline of 0mega "Finding Unity in Diversity" h/t @durgadas - I believe it's definitely in the air and we have a motivated collective of humans who joined... maybe just because of that... so yes to "TE process to building the 0mega"

@solsista asked to me to share this here:

i‚Äôve been thinking about how I could talk to the users, and it might help you as well for making token engineering easier to learn Dinner service as a metaphor. Throughout this process, you are also getting to know them as humans (what are they like outside of here) - what are they like - Introduce the concept of the restaurant (why should they get excited about the menu? a story they can tell their friends) - Ask them what looks good in drinks(in this case features of the product) - If they don‚Äôt know educate them so that they can make a decision themselves - pay attention to how they make a decision (do they ask what others do? Do they think about what they like in other places?) - Then serve them what they asked for - Ask them how they like what was served (if happy yay, if not, what do they not like about it?) - Give them recommendations (business needs, a story they can tell their friends) then ask what they want for their meal of multiple courses (in this case, the MVP that lets them do what they need to do in this space) - Pay attention to how they make a decision again - Pay attention to how they react to waiting - Serve them what they ordered - Ask them how they like what was served - Tell them there are treats available (in this case rewards) - What do they like as a treat? What feels rewarding? Would they even order a treat? - What do they care about when deciding what the treat should be? - What do they think about the whole experience? Are they happy with the cost of the experience? Do they feel like it was worth the cost? Would they come back? (Are they happy with what was asked of them as a user eg personal info, time, money) - Do they mention wanting to try something else next time?

I think it helps with anticipating their needs (knowing this journey you must experience together and helping them flow through it easily but maintaining constant conversation). Sometimes they don‚Äôt know what they need, so we give them the information they need in order to make a decision on what to ‚Äúorder‚Äù or which features to use or which rewards to take advantage of Maybe in the future there won‚Äôt be a need for websites, word of mouth is enough because we deliver so much value and improve their lives so much and help them self actualise much easier. It‚Äôs like the popularity of the ‚Äòrestaurant‚Äô increases as friends tell their friends about that place and they write reviews. If they‚Äôre really unhappy with the experience they can ‚Äòfork‚Äô or evolve into a community/protocol that suits them better or it could become a new product you deliver. And if they‚Äôre only a little bit unhappy we‚Äôll we‚Äôve made sure to always have constant conversations with them so we can hear their problems directly, and improve the current product.

I‚Äôd imagine creating the dual pathways for the uninformed and informed at multiple steps of their te journey Eg area 1 TE concept A) do you know what TE is? If not let me explain what it is and why it‚Äôs awesome B) you already know! Great pick from our menu of subject areas from the crypto economic flower 2 crypto economic flower A) know what you‚Äôre interested in? Go ahead and pick it B) need recommendations? These have been popular and people have found it useful 3) rewards how would you like to be rewarded? A) Get paid to learn? (for those bootstrapping?) B) Earn rep points by sharing your learnings? We‚Äôd have to dive into what their motivations are to generate reward ideas

we could e.g. have the case of sushiswap x whatever insights this "Sabotage Manual" has and prep it as a situation - or so... but it's serious (loads of) work, I'd guess...

so in the beginning it might be wiser to stick to focus groups, and situations extracted prepared from experience where ethical dilemma in a token economy as token engineer and/or participant

yes... have look, software hacks are actually "pretty straight forward" - with an interesting "ideal" that is/was floating around: "a legit hack" if the smart contract has a bug (whereas elsewhere the tech community came to the consensus that wrt security issues there is a "moral way to report it" ... that could be one, it's about legal vs. lawful vs. legit vs. moral etc (edited)

when we look for situations wher "harm was done" ... can imagine we find it in the two latter principles:

the first two came out of discussion of situations where one can't possibly "be right"

what are your thoughts/association when hearing "action in inaction" ?

_15-Dec-21 10:21 AM_:

True. Hacks are pretty straightforward. When it is contextual, what could be the guiding lights? "action in inaction" -there is both a positive and negative connotation. Positive -> let it emerge. Negative -> Wilful negligence.

"misfeasance is an act that occurs when one individual who has a legal duty of care to another individual makes a mistake that results in harm"

How is it unique in the Token context?

One, there need not be a very strong punitive constrain from a higher or top down authority. The "degrees of freedom" (inapt use of the phrase) is larger. The responsibility is larger. Fat protocols puts a lot under the hood. Information and knowledge asymmetries are much larger.

"Misfeasance refers to an action that is unintentional" ...hmmmh; I think that's the core of it, no? (1) the intention is set by each peer (2) "legal duty" is the social norms (cultural build) and smart contracts (technical build) [and still there is the legal duty, as these networks are registered as an entity in some jurisdiction].

this brings us to "Ethics of Experimentation" and that is not unique to Tokens - but we don't explicate it. The "Enable Informed Participation" plays to that notion: ppl need to grasp and understand what is at stake - and consent.

Is everyone aware that the TEC is an experiment? It is the first field experiment of Commons Stack (Augmented Bonding Curve, Conviction Voting, Handbook with Cultural/Technical Build) (edited)

<img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f92f.png" width=50 height=50>

2

which means we e.g. do the proposals and go through the process as both experimters and experimentees - so all insights we have is to be fed back to improve, through the phases.

So as they say to "protect the bottom line" each participant is advised to contribute what they love and enjoy, and see the funding distribution (which is experimental) as an additional extrinsic reward / giftback rather than sizing up individuals's hourly rate

[[thread]: A PID type of controller for ethical direction giving? With tokenisation it may be feasible...](about:blank#)

_15-Dec-21 03:44 PM_:

well we've been hacking our thermostats' PID and replaced it with a really dumb ML algorithm after a year of data, and it works better - so I don't buy that PID is the solution - but I buy into the goal of reducing need for governance on things that can be learnt from data by algorithms much better than by humans (or PIDs ) - so that humans have more time for sensemaking and actual deliberation, creating deeper connections to themselves their peers and their environment (what algorithms can't)

WG 0mega - Agenda (Weekly Wed. 8PM CET)

[exploratory phase doc] As of 09/06/2021 Agenda & Notes of Working Group 0mega Weekly Wednesdays 20:00 CET, in 0mega Voice Channel Short Description The Working Group 0mega started with a rather big question of ‚ÄúHow can we enable Token Engineering Ethos to emerge from such diverse backgrou...

I've been thinking what would be the focus of WG meetings, when we now start organizing initiatives separately... immensely interesting signals emerged in the past months about diversity (I may be biased), I'd love to take on, also it would help us make more sense of the tagline "Finding Unity in Diversity"... @Letty you edited somewhere "Integrating"... what should be the structure of our weekly gatherings, e.g. Initiative updates + Sensemaking of larger topics and/or focus group planning? etc. curious about your thoughts & wishes

_05-Jan-22 11:41 AM_:
Hey! I‚Äôm feeling quite ill so I will likely just listen in and say thoughts in chat. I might have to skip it if I feel worse later. Couple notes from me: - @Mount Manu and I will be working together on some tasks already on notion - is there a way we can work together with Longtail Financial with their TE Bootcamp? I would love to hear about more initiatives that you are aware is happening that could help those learning to design token economies. I have been sharing the hitchhiker sessions/articles and TE Academy, and people find them very helpful. Is there a workflow that a person can follow that allows them to learn from all the available resources (including what we are currently creating) that I can guide someone through? - I have also been asked to give feedback on projects before and I was wondering if there‚Äôs anyone more knowledgeable I could direct them to so they can gain more benefit? - while people are working through the library, is there any where they can get feedback on their projects in general? So a way for them to check if they have applied their learnings from the library and sessions ‚Äòwell‚Äô? Already seen people wanting feedback as I said above. - re planning and thoughts and wishes, I would love it if we had a doc specifically for recording thoughts even when not in a meeting that we can all refer to. For example, if I am not able to attend, I could have written my thoughts under the questions listed in agenda. Or maybe it can be in notion for specific topics? - for tasks that involve writing, should we agree on an outline then once that outline is formed, person doing the task can go off and write it and then bring back here for feedback? Should we add a section in each Notion task for people to sign up specifically just for giving feedback? Would be great first task for TEC newcomer too

[Hey! I‚Äôm feeling quite ill so I will likely just listen in and say thoughts in chat. I might have to skip it if I feel worse later. Couple notes from me: - @Mount Manu and I will be working together on some tasks already on notion - is there a way we can work together with Longtail Financial with their TE Bootcamp? I would love to hear about more initiatives that you are aware is happening that could help those learning to design token economies. I have been sharing the hitchhiker sessions/articles and TE Academy, and people find them very helpful. Is there a workflow that a person can follow that allows them to learn from all the available resources (including what we are currently creating) that I can guide someone through? - I have also been asked to give feedback on projects before and I was wondering if there‚Äôs anyone more knowledgeable I could direct them to so they can gain more benefit? - while people are working through the library, is there any where they can get feedback on their projects in general? So a way for them to check if they have applied their learnings from the library and sessions ‚Äòwell‚Äô? Already seen people wanting feedback as I said above. - re planning and thoughts and wishes, I would love it if we had a doc specifically for recording thoughts even when not in a meeting that we can all refer to. For example, if I am not able to attend, I could have written my thoughts under the questions listed in agenda. Or maybe it can be in notion for specific topics? - for tasks that involve writing, should we agree on an outline then once that outline is formed, person doing the task can go off and write it and then bring back here for feedback? Should we add a section in each Notion task for people to sign up specifically just for giving feedback? Would be great first task for TEC newcomer too Ô∏è  (edited)](about:blank#)

_12-Jan-22 03:16 PM_:

I'm imagining something similar to what @Mert Ozd mentioned, how we would have Omega core team, and then some funds allocated to Omega bounties. So in the library notion, under how to contribute, we would have a section that talks about what contributing would be like for each contribution type: - core omega team contributor - seed curators - community curator - casual omega task bounty hunter (edited)

_12-Jan-22 03:16 PM_:

I'll look into it and share in the blog post (for ourselves and other)

Right - we'll need to do that with the 15k I talked about maybe having 3 spreads - 5k 5k 5k in Phase 1 So in Phase 1.1 splitting 5k only for core members

Phase 1.2 5k core members (3.5k) and bounties (1.5k) ??

And Phase 1.3 to be decided

_12-Jan-22 04:27 PM_:

maybe it has only one attribute of which there are three possible choices - TE library donor, TE subject matter expert/ curator, practicing TE? - Donors will mint the donor type (without need to be vetted), and pay with whatever amount they want ^- they can also choose which topics to donate towards as Letty said - TE Subject Matter Experts/ Curator must be vetted before their wallet address is allowed to mint? (can mint free maybe?, but with option to donate) - practicing TE must be vetted before their wallet address is allowed to mint and donate to the initiative (edited)

TEC can even be a donor, once the Omega WG becomes a subDAO

Great News (&feedback!): Lydia is also excited about how we setup and make use of focus group to get to TE Ethical principles in participatory action research (she was the one initially guiding us, and explained it etc.) - she will get more involved and also take on focus group lead & analysis, i.e. making better use of the immense value, then "only" extracting TE Ethical principles, which is what we could afford with the current skills aboard... now it becomes more interesting! ...some ecosystem value add is emerging out of our 0mega initiatives

so I did add focus on that for next WG call:

please add comments directly if there is a topic that you want to go for

one that kept coming up is Diversity, but we'll go over them all

if you came across a new topic that is building up, please remember adding it to the topics list

maybe a little intro to George, for those who didn't know him (like myself, but I'm sure will resonate immediately) - he has kickedoff a hackalong around "Enlivening Value Flows" last week

- I wonder if we could get LTF to pay for advising TEs (providing support to learners), and in exchange we direct learners to their bootcamp, and increasing their TEs and therefore projects they can do - I also am wondering if TE Academy could also fund seed curator for directing learners to TE Academy after, increasing their learner nums (which makes them more reputable) - Then we can just focus on spending the funds on seed curators (to add to pay from TE Academy, making it more attractive), contributors, AND learners can earn money for learning

Perhaps the steps can instead be:

**1.**

Decide where you would like to focus your curation on.

**a.**

You can choose which petal/area of the crypto-economic flower. <Insert crypto-economic flower>

**b.**

You can create an original curation focus, with an underlying principle or theory that links together several crypto-economic patterns or disciplines.

**2.**

Add resources directly related to the area you have chosen. These could be academic papers, blog posts, excerpts from books, videos etc.

**a.**

You can choose to add your own content

**b.**

You can also choose to add others' content For both a and b, we encourage that you include a curator's explanation on why you think those resources are important. Try to keep the number of your resources chosen between 5 and 10 (we know, it'll be hard

[Sorry for asking a total noobie question, I'd like to find out whether there's already some action research process in place, by which the global repository of valuable multidisciplinary knowledge (structured by Omega's 8-petal "flower mandala") will be informed by the actual challenges in the cryptoeconomic systems, which token engineers and token users run into?

resonates a lot .. if I'm not mistaken TE Academy itself will be cofunded from TEC and other DAOs that it provides research programs for. So this would suggest the TEC Lib is a useful research in TE Commons, and specifically useful for people starting their learning journey in TE Academy --> instead of TEC pay TE A pay TEC Lib, I'd suggest to go the direct way TEC pay TEC Lib and TE A underscore its usefulness so the funds are secured... but sure, if TE A can support now already that would make a difference to TEC Lib --> @Mert Ozd @Letty wdyt?

ok, so this Wednesday is all about TE C' Lib, let's make most of @nic's contributions and also what she had in mind people! would be great if we all can find ways to help her work continue even during a little sabbatical. Also curious about the experience, how we're handling hand-overs, coming in and out of participants during heavy work load periods etc... would be great if we'd found fluid ways

coach @durgadas could we come up with a reflection on what framework for radical agile is emerging, after having seen "some data" how work gets done here? ...maybe that's part of the nurturing <<- let's add this to next week, we can share a bit of our experience with virtuous cycles, and what else came up

I know it exists, I can play, but it just doesn't compute... hence whatever roles/rules we've come up with up to now, as long as they have things to do with roles and associated status (I understand we feel it is needed for coordination, but I believe we're just being too lazy or not imaginative enough yet... and that coordination - sense of direction needs to have its source in the self, for self-organization and/or self-sovereignty to be experienced and not a mere concept to strive for)

and am sorry for my words "too lazy" "not imaginative enough" ... I don't mean it the mean way, and with we, I mean humankind

one of Hegel's tangents on diversity (reading him like a non-dualist thinker trying to contemplate what god was thinking before making the universe, somewhat in the style of the whale/petunia scene from the hitchhikers guide) The Science of Logic "Remark 3 Now if the first determinations of reflection, identity, diversity, and opposition, have been formulated each as a principle, all the more should the one determination into which they pass over as in their truth, namely contradiction, be grasped and enunciated as a principle: ‚ÄúAll things are in themselves contradictory,‚Äù in the sense, moreover, that as contrasted with the other this proposition expresses rather the truth and the essence of things. ‚Äì The contradiction that emerges in opposition is only the developed nothing which is contained in identity and came to the fore in the claim that the principle of identity says nothing. This negation further determines itself into difference and into opposition, which is now the posited contradiction. It is, however, one of the basic prejudices of previous logic and of ordinary thought that contradiction is not as essential and immanent a determination as identity. But in fact, if order of precedence were an issue, and the two determinations were to be held separate, it would be the principle of contradiction that should be taken as the more profound and the more essential. For in contrast to it, identity is only the determination of simple immediacy, of inert being, whereas contradiction is the root of all movement and life; it is only in so far as something has a contradiction within it that it moves, is possessed of instinct and activity.

But I do agree that practically, I like to say that the greatest approximation toward truth we have is paradox, which is deeper than contradictions

Even this discussion sparks my curiousity to dive that question even more ! Anyways, I believe we can create two phase focus group around that question. Initial phase could be narrowing down the research question, collect case studies as you suggested(If finding case studies become harder than we expect we can always create thought experiments). And discuss about what we have formed and have a collective research. And the third phase could be creating outputs from what we have discussed. (articles, talks, maybe ethics party

<img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f604.png" width=50 height=50>

etc.) Also, I believe comparative analysis with traditional way of creating policies and DAO style policy making in terms of "behavior design" would be very interesting topic to dive in. (edited)

One way to think of fractal (hierarchical) branching structures is that they have a balance of small, medium and large because each one of those fills a certain role and the combination optimizes cross-scale circulation. This amounts to a kind of **Goldilocks Rule**: you need appropriate size organisations and networks that are ‚Äújust right‚Äù for each scale of an economy and society. You need the small guys for small scale activity and circulation that reaches every nook and cranny. You need the medium guys for regional activity and circulation, and you need the big guys for rapid transit and large-scale endeavours. *Sally* [https://www.circularconversations.com/conversations/follow-energy-patterns-to-build-healthy-systems](https://www.circularconversations.com/conversations/follow-energy-patterns-to-build-healthy-systems)

_31-Jan-22 03:46 PM_:

I just realized in a talk about "gardens" with Chuy that I'm having real difficulty with the idea of "voting". Voting always seems to take place in some Omnibus fashion. For example, in the recent Commons Upgrade, we talked a LOT about the parameters, and I wish now that I'd been able to "vote" upon each aspect of those across the top 1,2,3,4,5 as separate items, since they determine VERY different things. Similarly, there was a near-universal bias in 90% of the params calls about The Money parts and very little about how to manage the changes. This only changed in the final few days when I brought this up in all the meetings I was in. So, I'm becoming increasingly skeptical of the proliferation of voting platforms and feel like we should focus on Needs- Met or Not Met and trying to optimize our DAO, rewards systems and so on to meet the needs of the people participating. I don't think we 1) Survey our user base 2) Identify their needs 3) Respond to those needs very effectively, since the ways we are setting up our governance structures are quite similar other other "representative" systems that exist in the legacy cultural codebase. Instead, I feel we should focus on optimizing for HUMAN NEEDS in as detailed a way as we can manage to work out, and create systems based on "representing" THOSE NEEDS across the board, rather than assuming some human being can adequately do so. By focusing on "stewards" as representatives, we fall prey to their specific strengths and blind spots, rather than focusing on reducing blind spots and augmenting strengths OF EVERYONE because we're all human beings. If we have similar structures to those abusive setups, what actual shifts can be made in the way we do things? The problems we've had ARE VERY STRUCTURAL in nature, so what good does it do to produce "nice" people without structural changes with differing fundamentals? We seem to change the fundamentals ABOUT THE MONEY but seem reluctant to do so within our own organizations

I think it's a fundamental mistake to assume any one steward can adequately represent anyone else. I think this is a MAJOR structural problem, and it's becoming clearer the more I participate here.

Focus on individuals means we will think in Divided ways

By focusing on commonalities AT EVERY LEVEL, I think we'll have a better chance at being resilient, since it literally wouldn't matter who is participating, since we optimized for HUMANS and not for a specific Representative Structure

Similar to Omnibus Voting Omnibus Representation makes numerous assumptions for the sake of management ease that have side effects we might be somewhat blind to

So, rather than having a DAO, we have a Semi-Centralized Bureaucracy, headed by people with good intentions and plenty of time, but perhaps not the skills or self-awareness to properly execute that function without a serious examination of their suitability for such a position.

So, these strengths of the representative are then overused and overemphasized whereas their weaknesses are as in denial as they are. This is not targeted at anyone, as no one can be the perfect representative of a diverse group.

Further, I see this as a great impediment toward diversity as well, since diversity is not a "line item", but rather in such a system, almost doomed to repeat the individual's awareness or lack thereof by default.

Worse, is that few people want to conduct a serious examination of a certain individual who is spending a LOT of time and energy as it might come across as a criticism of them specifically

Avoiding all this is a strict focus on underlying needs and determining how effective we are at meeting or not meeting those for the maximum number of people in the maximum number of situations. Voting in the way we currently are, isn't granular enough to accommodate this, and, in my view, neither is representative governance, so the ways of addressing both are through voting, which leads me back to my original point.

I'm interested in any feedback you have on this

Even our technical efforts fall prey to many of these same structural assumptions, piggybacking off of the governance and voting and so on.

I proposed to do this - " 1) Survey our user base 2) Identify their needs 3) Respond to those needs very effectively" in the dashboard idea, basically setting up weekly user interviews (min 3 members a week) so that we're constantly staying up to date with how people feel about how things work here, and as they change as people. I think I tied it to the quests/task board thing (much like how dework works)

I looked over your stuff and it's closer than what we have now, but I think it's equally important to identify WHY we're choosing THAT or THIS in terms of where our top-level concerns are. What I see is that it's Social Vernacular to take a Stewards-First approach, then Needs/Feelings second.

It's also important to get that the onboarding process I see us with assumes no Hubspot, and the Quests being run via Discord, when we could use Hubspot automation to give people who sign up or achieve certain levels a pre-made outline of how to progress

I see Metagame using this model, and it appears to work for them, but transitioning people out of Web2 into Web3 still means using email for onboarding, which we almost entirely ignore in the DAO space in my experience.

This Famous Livestreamer Stole $500,000 From His Fans

I caught Ice Poseidon taking over $500,000 from the crypto project CXCOIN... so I confronted him about it. Paul Denino, or Ice Poseidon launched CXCOIN in July and told his skeptics that there was nothing to worry about... the money was "locked away"... this was a "long-term project". It turns out this was all a lie. Paul Denino, Ice Poseido...

yeah I didn‚Äôt include much of the whys on that post cause I wanted to focus on the features. But my desire behind the idea is that everyone can do what feels right to them since they‚Äôre interfacing directly with the dashboard which is the limbs of the dao and stewards can still be there for support but the focus is on making it customisable to the users cognitive abilities/limits, and peer support via social groups (external to working groups) or via advice from everyone rather than just the stewards, and removing bottlenecks for info. Because it‚Äôs easier to work with the dashboard (hopefully decreasing cognitive cost of participating to the user), people can be more involved and customise their experience based on their style of interfacing with DAOs. For example for me I prefer to not do meetings, and I like doing many many small quick tasks (like answering peoples questions). I like talking occasionally but only in certain environments, like omega which feels good and is more my style. So basically focusing on easing some of the pains first, so they can start to feel who they are. Then we maintain a constant conversation on how the users feel, as well as having our peers (friend groups within dao) there to support our journey, instead of waiting until the pain reaches the tipping point and the conversation has to happen on why we should change something. But anyways that was my thinking from back then and I‚Äôve changed now. I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre bringing up how you feel. Like you‚Äôre the nerves of this body that is TEC. (edited)

"human beings continually play status games" - this is the definition of Monopoly for me. I know it exists, I can play, but it just doesn't compute... hence whatever roles/rules we've come up with up to now, as long as they have things to do with roles and associated status (I understand we feel it is needed for coordination, but I believe we're just being too lazy or not imaginative enough yet... and that coordination - sense of direction needs to have its source in the self, for self-organization and/or self-sovereignty to be experienced and not a mere concept to strive for)

<img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f61b.png" width=50 height=50>

(or maybe I don't get the joke - that happens a lot)
so dearest people, I apologize for being late with the agenda and not able to catch up properly on the discussions above - some of it is though the topic tonight: updating our WG "Om-nifesto" (h/t @Letty just saw this comment

<img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f61b.png" width=50 height=50>

) wrt "Working Style" and "Members" and how we fund (I'd propose open research calls for focus groups that can be filled by members of this group as well as researchers active in the topic of focus group, preferably social scientists/anthropologists capable of properly conducting and analysing focus groups - which feed with insights the TE Ethics initiative

What type of work is needed to nurture the TE C' Library that the working group can provide as an underlying? Or are we good with running it as a "useful product" (this seems the way to go from also the comments above) i.e. "exit to community" after seeding it in the group here and seeing it being used and useful (i.e. not the case of the comic above haha)

Please have a look here: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FM5lokbcJZFXALDfwn-NIjJ1MSUjgoYgecCPwEnTydU/edit#heading=h.2rrkm319a20q](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FM5lokbcJZFXALDfwn-NIjJ1MSUjgoYgecCPwEnTydU/edit#heading=h.2rrkm319a20q)

Let's think if anyone providing valuable contributions here is not getting appropriately acknowledged through initiatives, or there are things especially those of you who are active participants would love to see funded, but you don't see them appropriately acknowledged in the funding proposals of the two initiatives already.

Also there is the role of WG lead(s) I would encourage those who are good in planning and keeping track to take on - especially if you are already familiar/want to get very familiar with DeWork etc.

Also please don't feel shy if you need more stewarding than I can provide at the moment, I'd like to address it before it can become an "energy blocker"

<img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f609.png" width=50 height=50>

My time budget for TEC will get very very tight, it seems I can only provide what we already promised in the TE initiatives and help see them through as a steward, mainly focusing on enabling self-organizations --> hence back full circle: Working Style, can we apply some Radical Agile processes and test them for anti-fragility.

have a look here: [https://blog.teammood.com/radical-agility](https://blog.teammood.com/radical-agility) it seems to be work in and on itself to innovate around

[with respect to an individual like @durgadas a broader subject matter expert role, like "expert generalist" or something like that could better account for the necessity for people who are essentially jacks-of-all-trades](about:blank#)

and the very essence of 0mega is the appreciation that we need all perspectives to see through the rabbit hole

even @durgadas humbly says he represents half of the flower ( which is a lot obviously)

_03-Feb-22 08:24 AM_:

going over the manifesto - I think the integral approach, as is the cryptoeconomics flower a good starting point/prism... looking at wikipedia I was concerned with it's "ah spiritual stuff" trigger that it will naturally create with the rational mind - but (a) I believe most TEs/web3 are beyond or at the brink of materialistic worldview (which cannot be said for the crypto "movement") (b) it really is smart and funny too, and offers trails we can follow and play with, too

like they played with Memes, "...with the hope that it will separate the Mean Green Meme from legitimate healthy GREEN"

the process model, moving towards "A-perspectival", i.e. transcending paradigms [https://integralreviewofbooks.wordpress.com/category/process-model-of-integral-theory/](https://integralreviewofbooks.wordpress.com/category/process-model-of-integral-theory/) which also was a hook in Systems Thinking Dana Maedows

About the "roles" for regulars - I think the addition of researchers/facilitators instead of subject matter experts covers us well, please check again if that is appropriate and leave a comment what can be improved @Letty, @nic , @durgadas @Mount Manu @Mert Ozd

reminder: this is "only" the groundwork of WG 0mega, your acknowledgement if you're also active in one of the two initiatives TE C'library and TE Ethics Practice sessions is already accounded in the respective initiative proposals.

I did a deep reading and my impression is that, although we still need 'to frame roles/actions' is better fleshed out and the purpose bit emerges clearer.

By 'still need' I meant we are somehow also constrained by our own frameworks but doing well imho.

Hallo, congrats on the energy boosted required to do this!

I see this provides background/context on how to develop a process for the TE Ethics research groups weaved with the C' Library + gamified TEC.

The "Principles in TE" (1st sessions) are a 'seed curation¬¥ and a 1st lego block for researchers to come in, delved into previous thinking and build upon it later.

Working from this, we could have: Principles thinking: seed curations + Categories of research under the initiatives Worldviews fractals: curations + researchers under specific categories and petals Petal/capacity building: under resources + support groups across the library + sessions to evolve potential commons with TEC as mentor/hirer/granter.

Hello @Nate0909, we have two main initiatives that is actively developing now 1- TE Conslience Library : [https://forum.tecommons.org/t/te-consilience-library-an-0mega-wg-initiative/751](https://forum.tecommons.org/t/te-consilience-library-an-0mega-wg-initiative/751) 2- TE Ethics Participatory Research : [https://forum.tecommons.org/t/te-ethics-participatory-research-an-0mega-wg-initiative/746](https://forum.tecommons.org/t/te-ethics-participatory-research-an-0mega-wg-initiative/746) our initiatives are now in advice process in the forum. You can find details of the proposals there.

TE Consilience Library - an 0Mega WG initiative

TE Consilience Library TL;DR Updated on Feb 1, 2022. This initiative of the Working Group 0mega will create a 3-phased multidisciplinary library on token engineering to provide a learning and research environment for our community. This funding proposal is to facilitate the first phase. In the first phase 0mega WG contributors will build a lib...

Collaboration, Not Automation The most effective technologies are tools for human collaboration. The personal computer, mobile devices, the Internet ‚Äì all are connective technologies that actively engage us and facilitate our coordination. They gave us the modern computer revolution.

Some forget this and now think the future for technology is inevitably in automated systems built to manipulate or replace humans. Nevertheless, this is a confused and dystopian view of technology‚Äôs role in society.

For our digital systems to succeed, they must work for people. The focus needs to be on the human experience.

[I just realized in a talk about "gardens" with Chuy that I'm having real difficulty with the idea of "voting". Voting always seems to take place in some Omnibus fashion. For example, in the recent Commons Upgrade, we talked a LOT about the parameters, and I wish now that I'd been able to "vote" upon each aspect of those across the top 1,2,3,4,5 as separate items, since they determine VERY different things. Similarly, there was a near-universal bias in 90% of the params calls about The Money parts and very little about how to manage the changes. This only changed in the final few days when I brought this up in all the meetings I was in. So, I'm becoming increasingly skeptical of the proliferation of voting platforms and feel like we should focus on Needs- Met or Not Met and trying to optimize our DAO, rewards systems and so on to meet the needs of the people participating. I don't think we 1) Survey our user base 2) Identify their needs 3) Respond to those needs very effectively, since the ways we are setting up our governance structures are quite similar other other "representative" systems that exist in the legacy cultural codebase. Instead, I feel we should focus on optimizing for HUMAN NEEDS in as detailed a way as we can manage to work out, and create systems based on "representing" THOSE NEEDS across the board, rather than assuming some human being can adequately do so. By focusing on "stewards" as representatives, we fall prey to their specific strengths and blind spots, rather than focusing on reducing blind spots and augmenting strengths OF EVERYONE because we're all human beings. If we have similar structures to those abusive setups, what actual shifts can be made in the way we do things? The problems we've had ARE VERY STRUCTURAL in nature, so what good does it do to produce "nice" people without structural changes with differing fundamentals? We seem to change the fundamentals ABOUT THE MONEY but seem reluctant to do so within our own organizations](about:blank#)

_08-Feb-22 02:45 PM_:

just re-reading this and I just wanted to say thank you again for sharing this. I am feeling the importance and relevance of what you're saying so much more now. How can we make it so that when issues are brought up, they're not just swept under? What sort of steps can happen so that after being 'allowed' to voice your concern to an audience, something can actually be done rather than *just* discussed? Does an individual need to rally up others who agree in order for their concerns to be heard? That seems unfair. How can we safely share something that's not working for us which may feel like criticism to others? How can things be improved if people feel scared to talk of people in power? Can we work self awareness into our culture? From what I remember ideas around this has been brought up but I am not aware of it actually being a thing yet.

Also I wonder if there's a better way of keeping newcomers to Omega up to date and open up the space for them to contribute and be part of the omega family than just linking the proposals. And if newcomers join an omega meeting, how to make them feel welcome and gain context.

Well, I kinda rage quit today as I brought some of this up in the Soft Gov call and didn't really hear anything that welcoming. I'd decided I would share what I have been experiencing lately and the feedback I got during that was really triggering for me, so I guess I didn't get to explain everything I wanted in any clear way. I'm trying to generalize a personal experience and show evidence for why I think we have some structural issues, but I can see that people's attachment to existing social structures is impeding them hearing the message fully. I won't stop trying to speak truth here, but I didn't expect things to show up like they did, as what I had been saying about this up until then had been well-received.

@durgadas I am grateful for your expression in SoftGov yesterday. I appreciate very much your being vocal on your experience and on generalizing it, as it is very important and relevant. I think everyone is listening and hearing you, even if first reactions don‚Äôt appear as that and/or even if we all have so much to learn through this kind of valuable discomfort and open expression of something so significant for the future of the TEC and any DAO and any form of positive development of interactive human structuring.

_09-Feb-22 12:51 PM_:

"If someone like me who is prominent in this group can run into these kinds of issues...what's happening to people who aren't? Are we leaving them by the wayside? And that's why I'm suggesting we put in other structural things like Liberating Structures that actively subvert the potential for these types of things to happen. ... Voting is just not enough. There are a lot of ways we can break voting and doing omnibus things is one of the ways to do that. There's ways to break participation and working groups, and we're falling for a bunch of them in the exact same way that many of the things that we're trying to construct our way out of have already done."

You've put so eloquently a feeling that some feel disempowered to voice, or are ignored/silenced when voiced. (edited)

Do you have more on " SALSA-based framework for intellectual property rights" --> putting into topic bucket - I see we had also "tagged" @JeremyTheGospel under "Working Style" - I saw he was there today, we should engage and ask about Liberating Structures and more of these new frameworks... definitely becoming a

VitaDAO - Longevity Research DAO

VitaDAO is the world‚Äôs first decentralised intellectual property collective. Its mission is to extend the human lifespan by researching, financing, and commercialising longevity therapeutics in an open and democratic manner. VitaDAO is a web3-based decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO).

[I just realized in a talk about "gardens" with Chuy that I'm having real difficulty with the idea of "voting". Voting always seems to take place in some Omnibus fashion. For example, in the recent Commons Upgrade, we talked a LOT about the parameters, and I wish now that I'd been able to "vote" upon each aspect of those across the top 1,2,3,4,5 as separate items, since they determine VERY different things. Similarly, there was a near-universal bias in 90% of the params calls about The Money parts and very little about how to manage the changes. This only changed in the final few days when I brought this up in all the meetings I was in. So, I'm becoming increasingly skeptical of the proliferation of voting platforms and feel like we should focus on Needs- Met or Not Met and trying to optimize our DAO, rewards systems and so on to meet the needs of the people participating. I don't think we 1) Survey our user base 2) Identify their needs 3) Respond to those needs very effectively, since the ways we are setting up our governance structures are quite similar other other "representative" systems that exist in the legacy cultural codebase. Instead, I feel we should focus on optimizing for HUMAN NEEDS in as detailed a way as we can manage to work out, and create systems based on "representing" THOSE NEEDS across the board, rather than assuming some human being can adequately do so. By focusing on "stewards" as representatives, we fall prey to their specific strengths and blind spots, rather than focusing on reducing blind spots and augmenting strengths OF EVERYONE because we're all human beings. If we have similar structures to those abusive setups, what actual shifts can be made in the way we do things? The problems we've had ARE VERY STRUCTURAL in nature, so what good does it do to produce "nice" people without structural changes with differing fundamentals? We seem to change the fundamentals ABOUT THE MONEY but seem reluctant to do so within our own organizations](about:blank#)

I think this speaks to what Sally was talking about in oligarchic dysfunction, about how failure is a pattern, but after failure and restructuring, success happens...until the next failure. Therefore it's important to be open to

**"continue its evolution"**

by allowing for diversity of thought, even if it does not necessarily align with the narrative presented to the public of the organisation, or even if it does not align with the stewards' opinions. Otherwise, is it really a servant leadership? Is it really decentralised? Also allowing for play and experimentation which I distinctly remember is brought up often here at Omega

"for many of us funding won't change the situation" exactly, the responsibility shouldn't just be placed on us to 'keep things in check' on ethics, it should be part of the culture, to self-reflect and analyse how their shadow is affecting their behaviours within this space.

[Well, I kinda rage quit today as I brought some of this up in the Soft Gov call and didn't really hear anything that welcoming. I'd decided I would share what I have been experiencing lately and the feedback I got during that was really triggering for me, so I guess I didn't get to explain everything I wanted in any clear way. I'm trying to generalize a personal experience and show evidence for why I think we have some structural issues, but I can see that people's attachment to existing social structures is impeding them hearing the message fully. I won't stop trying to speak truth here, but I didn't expect things to show up like they did, as what I had been saying about this up until then had been well-received.](about:blank#)

it looks like the steward council call today is about power dynamics..perhaps @durgadas you could talk in more detail there

I won't make it to that call, nor the community one, but I took the time to go through part of this week's soft-gov call. I want to point out that I understand and share Durgadas' feelings/points about structural issues not being addressed (and lack of willingness to do so). Have a great weekend you all!

I participated - need to jump, but I'm listening to what @durgadas is saying about coming from abusive systems - that people need to unlearn

<img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f4af.png" width=50 height=50>

this is what moves me:

"I'm sorry... this is really not why I'm in web3... these are just same corporate structures. power money praise reputation please how shall we change anything starting with ourselves if we use the same only extrinsic rewards"

however, I just realize going through the Stewards Council and hearing all the other views, I understand it is not easy, and it is equally "entitled" to disregard that fact and check out "power doesn't compute on my machine"..., we are coming from such structures (edited)

perfect for a focus group...

Web3 to me is the practice/emergence of individuality within unity. That means putting the power back to the individual, so they feel that they can actually be responsible over their self rather than have a mistrust of their own abilities to be responsible. Also the creation of the culture of self-analysis and self-initiated growth (because they feel inspired to do so), rather than the collective forcing them into structures to be ‚Äògood‚Äô. That‚Äôs diversity to me, when individuals truly *can* be individuals. They‚Äôd feel empowered to not be affected/stand up to tyranny of others wills while honouring themselves and integrating their shadows. Unified self first, then we can have a unified collective.

"Conventional corporate forms legally code companies as assets or commodities, i.e., private property from which wealth can be extracted either through distributions or a sale. This framework mandates the prioritization of value-creation above purpose, and most commonly dislocates control over the business from its operations and stakeholders. This results in what the 20th Century economist Thorstein Veblen called ‚ÄúAbsentee Ownership‚Äù."

this is from intro of Steward Ownership - the legal framework we work off off incl. exit to community on one of the projects

TE Consilience Library - an 0Mega WG initiative

TE Consilience Library TL;DR Updated on Feb 1, 2022.

Also I wonder if there's a better way of keeping newcomers to Omega up to date and open up the space for them to contribute and be part of the omega family than just linking the proposals. And if newcomers join an omega meeting, how to make them feel welcome and gain context.

_10-Feb-22 04:28 PM_:

Maybe we look at everything as energies, as was said in the paper...so what do we give to Omega? What do we take from omega? What is given to us by omega? what is taken from us by omega? How do we take less, and create a culture of giving? how do we manage our energy reserves so that we aren't drained from giving too much or allowing to be taken from too much? How do we replenish ourselves without the need for taking? if we answer these questions we'll find a common pattern of how Omega gives to us, and how we give to omega...and we can maximise that so that both sides feel energised all the time. eventually omega can give to that which is external to omega I already feel it, it *feels different* here at Omega (edited)

"a common pattern of how Omega gives to us, and how we give to omega" this basically will guide us towards finding the intrinsic motivations

then we can break free from the dip, as we will feel energised to grow as individuals and as a unity of individuals..we won't have to take power/energy from people because we ourselves are energised. we know how to replenish so we won't feel the need to hoard/protect that energy, for we have created an environment of abundance (edited)

Hello Omega Team. I have been lurking in your discord for at least a week or two and I am delighted. I also would like to take this opportunity to !Praise this group as a whole. I have been reading through some of the recent comments and there seems to be some discord between some of the members. I have not been able to discern what the real issues are and as a newcomer I feel it is not my business, but what I am picking up is that there is a lot of passion here. It is obvious that you guys deeply care and are motivated by this subject. Happy to be here.

This has really been super interesting ... came here thinking I've figured out - but nah, not yet

however I think we have all of this captured in the topic bucket - and next week with kicking of the series (I guess it will be a series) on 0mega groundwork, we'll be opening that bucket [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SRvWH57956GjlRXxvVGgVF7w-Exvdi7TFhVwIbpPoLQ/edit#heading=h.crf1ztfc9rws](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SRvWH57956GjlRXxvVGgVF7w-Exvdi7TFhVwIbpPoLQ/edit#heading=h.crf1ztfc9rws)

please everyone have a look if something can be added, or taken away so we have a clear purpose ; also it seems we're redefining what focus groups are [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focus_group)

Focus group

A focus group is a group interview involving a small number of demographically similar people or participants who have other common traits/experiences. Their reactions to specific researcher/evaluator-posed questions are studied. Focus groups are used in market research to understand better people's reactions to products or services or participa...

_11-Feb-22 02:41 AM_:

I like these very much - with only one important suggestion, instead of focusing on the organization "0mega Working Group", we need to turn our attention to that organizations purpose ~ "TE Ethics and Ethos: Unity in Diversity" (same exercise can be done at the level of TEC)

So, the session in 2weeks 23rd then we can work on this - which means the initiatives need to self-organize to get the proposals into conviction voting. That requires some administrative work: wallets, xDAI (we'll get from Stewards budget @Mert Ozd and I can handle that) that needs to be done on WG level, so I'll add 5-10 mins in the beginning of each session, re multisigs.

all these chains ... l look into Minerva [https://minerva.digital/](https://minerva.digital/) seems to have good handling of those

Minerva Wallet

Minerva Wallet works like a physical wallet and can manage identity, data and money, all in one app. Within the vast Ethereum ecosystem it can connect to DApps via WalletConnect and is powered by the native SuperToken MIVA. The clean and simple user interface of this open-source wallet makes it easy to use for everyone.

I love that approach too

Also, I wrote a little abstract about next weeks groundwork. It is not completed yet but I wanted to share it to have some feedback if you have. So, I can shape it accordingly. (edited)

Here and there, within the definitions of token engineering the authors state that it is a practice of incentive structures designing. Since, the incentives of individuals affect tendencies of personal behaviors, on a broader scale it shapes the environment that we are living in. In other words, the structure shapes the agents and following that the agents shapes structure. Related to that circular relationship, in this learning group we would like to research on how the parameters of token engineering conditions our moral behaviors and how that moral behavior shapes our ‚Äúliving‚Äù environment. While researching that question we would also conduct a comparative analysis with traditional ‚Äútoken engineering‚Äù which has been conducted by central banks. The Central Bank as an undemocratic body (there is no public participation in choosing CB administration) has shaped our living environment by ‚Äúincentive designing‚Äù. For example, in 1979 US Finance minister Paul Volker initiated unprecedented interest rates (known as Volker shock) when US inflation rates were double digits. The negative interest rate at the time of before the shock suddenly increased to more than 5 percent real interest rate. This caused the sharp recession and rapid unemployment increase. Unemployment rose 5 percent to 10 percent between 1979 to 1982, whereas inflation fell from 13 percent to 3 percent between 1980 to 1983. In this learning group we will investigate how DAO‚Äôs are practicing those activities differently and what those differences mean for societies. (in terms of sovereignty, legitimacy, meritocracy and power)

(think this as starting point of the research, we could dive very diverse topics based on that approach)

[Maybe we look at everything as energies, as was said in the paper...so what do we give to Omega? What do we take from omega? What is given to us by omega? what is taken from us by omega? How do we take less, and create a culture of giving? how do we manage our energy reserves so that we aren't drained from giving too much or allowing to be taken from too much? How do we replenish ourselves without the need for taking? if we answer these questions we'll find a common pattern of how Omega gives to us, and how we give to omega...and we can maximise that so that both sides feel energised all the time. eventually omega can give to that which is external to omega I already feel it, it *feels different* here at Omega  (edited)](about:blank#)

_11-Feb-22 03:03 AM_:

having said that, we need to extract the pattern why "it feels different in 0mega" - I agree with that, it has a lot to do with the contributions of the participants, the discernment, and commitment to "let it emerge" ...the work style (also in the bucket list) <-- whilst working we're working on a new working style that starts with self-inquiry, enlivening self (what does it mean in TE, TEC context? Getting up to speed? Then the living library shall serve that purpose) , enlivening relationships (decent mentor /cc @Jolly LaMa @nic and folks from LTF - again the living library can be a good hang out place: "hey I saw your curation", "I saw you're also digging through the XYZ curation", "Help I'm stuck what does it even mean...") <--may be possible even during Notion Prototype through comment function? --- through this peer learning environment that is always on, always open, you get up to speed to a point where "enlivening systems" is a possibility - you know your contributions, your motivations, you met poeple with complementary views and skills etc etc. learnt about projects, needs where you can add value, or get together in a guild in the pluriverse of token networks and create value - all the while regular focus groups are helping to scan the ocean ground for TE Ethical Principles and Practices to emergy, provide a platform for collective inquiry

I would also add the literal "Skinnerian Token Economy" where rewards are used to change behavior of institutionalized humans to comply with a norm, meaning be "normal" - apparently very successfully. In extreme cases, one can argue this is good: i.e. "healthy for the person" and healthy for the ecosystem. However our world is not black and white, and we are all on a spectrum. There is the spectrum of that is neurotypical, and there is the spectrum of neurodiverse. I will argue that it is unhealthy for an ecosystem if individuals are rated on where they are on that spectrum and somehow (through voting?!) the collective determines who are on the un/healthy end ... this is a "statistical worldview", mechanistic: if you push here, it will do this. Thermodynamics is statistical, it is descriptive and predictive in closed systems... we're riding the waves of open oceans in global token networks.

@Mert Ozd if you spin up a doc, maybe more who would like to add a perspective can provide a short paragraph. It would be a great prepapartion, thank you, for rolling the ball

This goes well with the "flower" and current work on narratives/radical integral ethos research. Also sharing some small satori moments or "Evolutionary Coherence" epistemology:

In order to heal and shift worldviews that divide us, it is important to understand the underlying dynamics of the behavioral systems of such worldviews (Meadows, 1999, 2002). This deeper transformational change process is not a cognitive process. If it were simply a cognitive process, we would not have all the problems in the world we see today. Most people these days can identify what is wrong with the way we conduct our affairs, yet knowing this has not brought forth the deeper change for what is needed for our collective thrivability.

we have aimed to raise awareness about the systemic dynamics of our mechanistic worldviews. We have called this the polarization effect and explained why it is divisive. We have also aimed to provide inputs to the field of knowledge and practices relating to systemic thinking and behaviors, inspired by a more indigenous worldview (...)

>

Irrespective of the historical and evolutionary factors that contributed or gave rise to this polarization effect, the power to heal these underlying divisions rests within each of us. Healing is a process of returning to our wholeness.

**Our challenge now is how to (re)design our systems such that the systemic behaviors of which we are part cease to bring forth this divisive polarization effect. To (re)design our human systems in such a way that we finally become evolutionary coherent and supercoherent with our planetary and cosmic systems.**

"Justice as Fairness: Political not Metaphysical" is an essay by John Rawls, published in 1985. In it he describes his conception of justice.

Rawls arranges the principles in 'lexical priority', prior...

"Now that we don't have to adapt to compromises, but can engineer trade-offs away, how about we invent some characteristics of money that have never existed before? For instance, our money is now also a universal ledger of transactions. A trackable, auditable ledger that can tell us where money has been and what is has been used for. Or not. Because we can tweak the privacy dial and say individuals should have privacy and governments should be accountable. We can reset that societal conversation."

[This goes well with the "flower" and current work on narratives/radical integral ethos research. Also sharing some small satori moments or "Evolutionary Coherence" epistemology:](about:blank#)

In order to heal and shift worldviews that divide us, it is important to understand the underlying dynamics of the behavioral systems of such worldviews (Meadows, 1999, 2002). This deeper transformational change process is not a cognitive process. If it were simply a cognitive process, we would not have all the problems in the world we see today. Most people these days can identify what is wrong with the way we conduct our affairs, yet knowing this has not brought forth the deeper change for what is needed for our collective thrivability.

we have aimed to raise awareness about the systemic dynamics of our mechanistic worldviews. We have called this the polarization effect and explained why it is divisive. We have also aimed to provide inputs to the field of knowledge and practices relating to systemic thinking and behaviors, inspired by a more indigenous worldview (...)

>

Irrespective of the historical and evolutionary factors that contributed or gave rise to this polarization effect, the power to heal these underlying divisions rests within each of us. Healing is a process of returning to our wholeness.

**Our challenge now is how to (re)design our systems such that the systemic behaviors of which we are part cease to bring forth this divisive polarization effect. To (re)design our human systems in such a way that we finally become evolutionary coherent and supercoherent with our planetary and cosmic systems.**

no, if it is clear enough and you want to host a session you can use any of the Wednesdays that are upcoming (except the 23rd, as we've been forming it)

if you need more input from the group, and want more opinions etc (e.g. very new topic, never heard of here) then makes sense to park it first in topic bucket

It's a small moment of awareness is all it takes: [https://youtu.be/pCpLWbHVNhk](https://youtu.be/pCpLWbHVNhk) And then imagine being able to not only notice certain "structures" as they go by, but to note that others might want to live inside those structures, and others might see this journey as a vacation, or others might want to hold all the structures in their mind AND the contextual journey also, and talk about the relationships that exist between them.

I suggested we use ways to find signal as a great thing, and then use things like Liberating Structures and other methods as a response to the basic stimulus/response psychological requirement

I have a lot of ideas about this that I'd like to discuss and have heard talk around recently as it's been me out there saying that Something Is Wrong and people are hearing that and responding

I'd like to workshop ideas and create some things like this for sure

_17-Feb-22 12:01 PM_:

ok, it would be cool to look for which WG is best suited. 0mega has loads to do still (you promised 2 practice sessions, I'm hardly making progress with the one I promised due to time), wrt TE Ethics and letting the Ethos emerge - I totally get it that it of course very much relates! - and it can always be fallback solution to initiate it here. But I feel like with working groups SoftGov, Communitas, and Gravity - we might be able to share the work load.

Making changes like this takes a suite of tools and enough people to continue propagating it. LS can help, and that dovetails well with Cynefin for example

So yes I see two things here. 1) Find methods for enhancing empowerment/autonomy/agency or better to see the ways we have built barriers to that and 2) The existing worldviews discussion

For example: [https://www.liberatingstructures.com/9-what-so-what-now-what-w/](https://www.liberatingstructures.com/9-what-so-what-now-what-w/) is helpful in working out what you could do better next meeting.

Boomeritis

Boomeritis: A Novel That Will Set You Free is a polemical 2002 novel by American philosopher Ken Wilber, principally designed to explain Wilber's integral theory and to explain his concept of "Boomeritis". Wilber characterizes this as the deadly combination of a modern egalitarian worldview with a deep unquestioned narcissism commonly held by Ba...

_17-Feb-22 12:22 PM_:

totally agree - but when you say let's DDO is "trying to move" without inquiring whether people are ready, and what can be provided if they want to venture out of their current comfort zones

_17-Feb-22 12:22 PM_:

I'm not sure that's what DDOs are about

In fact, it seems to me that it's setting up a structure that allows us to meet them where they are and provide enabling constraints to allow their movement, and encourage it.

rather than forcing something

Unrelated to the above, but in terms of attracting learners and subject matter experts, I‚Äôm wondering if we should make our own twitter page for Omega, much like how gravity has its own twitter page so that we may promote omega initiatives outside of the forum (since we weren‚Äôt allowed to post on medium).

Should we make our own medium? I can see write ups coming out of the research that will be happening. As well as opportunities for educating TEs via articles. Or should omega write ups go in the library? (edited)

Should it be just subject matter experts adding to library? I wonder if 1-2-4-All could be applied in curation?

@Letty wants to prepare a group curation session for us! I think this is a great experience to put ourselves into the seed curator shoes, and improve the experience. For example, I don't think just having the "per petal curation" and also "one person curation" is walking the talk of "transdisciplinary art of token engineering". At least collaborating with 2 or more would be good... just some thoughts. At least one person should curate across more than one petal, to demonstrate "consiliencing" - What do you think?

_17-Feb-22 03:57 PM_:

I agree about the whole one person curation not walking the talk and is actually what I was thinking about....the whole decentralisation of powers/social rep. If one person curates their social rep increases, but if its collective curation then the organisation rep increases...which may help TEC become more wide known and trusted

hmmm I wonder how we can describe Omega initiatives better...examining ethos and ethics is too vague, and I'm not sure it communicates the importance of this stuff in TE practices. Then perhaps we can attract more TEs to help (edited)

I wonder if it would help if instead of simply describing what each WG is about during orientation, we could describe the current initiatives, this may bridge learning opportunities for TEs with the WG needs to advance TE

We could do the same with daily sustained heart rate and/or sleep - might be easier to verify (with use of a wearable). with a small enough trial group we could also trust manual input i think. it would be obvious enough to call out the fibbers.

[@Letty wants to prepare a group curation session for us! I think this is a great experience to put ourselves into the seed curator shoes, and improve the experience. For example, I don't think just having the "per petal curation" and also "one person curation" is walking the talk of "transdisciplinary art of token engineering". At least collaborating with 2 or more would be good... just some thoughts. At least one person should curate across more than one petal, to demonstrate "consiliencing" - What do you think?](about:blank#)

I have not contributed to any of the groups so far, but I am drawn to the Omega group. It seems like a wild bunch. You guys definitely have a lot of fun in here. In regards to the flower, academically I did undergrad in finance and I did a masters in Industrial/Systems engineering so I am completely captivated by thought of TE. Project management is my day job. The onboarding process is nice because it is so intentional. Head and shoulders above the onboarding on most other discord groups.

I think you just participated once, right? Promise you'll love it ... and might be coming in at the right time, hope you make it next week, when it's about Working Style
with that rather financial/engineering heavy background I'm curious why you're drawn to 0mega, often those are the best stories - if you don't like chat, remind me to aks you next week

Is God interested in the precision of our ritual or our mood in performing it?

_18-Feb-22 03:12 AM_:

#edit: I don't want receptionists for me... the entrance is a bit of a test for complexity tolerance, if we make people believe it's easy, super simple, smooth, you just need to follow another person who's been there before - then we would lose valuable insights of newcomers... I'm all game to make the experience more interesting, exciting - but not the kind of "someone tell me what to do"

This was very helpful - hopefully to all involved: One of the things you pointed out is that "it's going to be hard to get started" with further suggestions that we should focus on the outcome, and know the outcome first. I reflected on it. Instead, keeping true to the 0mega Manifesto, I edited the empty "Start Here" page, assuming that that may already elavate the barrier. Let's keep this feedback loop open, Dave. Let us know if this already is helpful for you to get started:

TE Consilience Library - an 0Mega WG initiative

let‚Äôs revisit this point, since it does not embody the consilience aspect of the library. The curations should definitely be transdisciplinary which would be across two or more of the petals. Also the annotations are useful when they can relate to curators experiences in Token Engineering and as participants in Token Economies. So whilst this do...

The table is talking about politics and it is a very lively discussion, a little disjointed but you think you get the gist so you offer your opinion. To your shock the table falls silent then bust out laughing at you because when you sat down you heard a discussion about politics, but what was really going on was a discussion about a sordid tryst'. Ok I'm being dramatic, but that is what comes to mind. I appreciate all the links you provided today. I think I am starting to get it. I ordered the book 'The usefulness of useless knowledge'. The Library project is an interesting project however because I presume we want it to be useful, but we also are compelled to fill it up with useless knowledge! I'm feeling giddy trying to figure it out in my head. I love what you guys are doing in this working group!!!

_19-Feb-22 04:10 AM_:

yes @durgadas is The Coach @MargaritaDave for complexity tolerance, helped me level up many times

if there's any TE specific asks "Where do I find..." do not hesitate to ask here - those questions are good for anyone! See , I had missed the newest version of the Notion Page

In the old one I came across a version of the Manifesto that said "The Library can fund the WG 0mega" - I am super happy that it's not taken over to the new version!

<img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f64f.png" width=50 height=50>

Because, and I am just reiterating for the newcomers and for all of us again:

TEC purpose is to fund TE public goods, which is the TE knowledge that exists not only in TEC or TE Community, the academy etc. but literally across all TE activities

one obvious and important TE public good is TE Ethics

hence TE Ethics will always be independently funded

A steward takes care

A manager manages a P&L position (profit & loss) - WG 0mega is not a P&L center in a for-profit organization.

I do not so much care about the implications, as I do care about making sure TE Ethics is independent - and it is participatory as in the rhetoric question we started with "Who owns TE Ethics"

we all do - and it cannot depend on whether there is funds for us to be or think or act ethically

TE Ethics is Particiaptory Action Research

at least these hold for us: We value the states and processes on the left - not those on the right: (edited)

If you perceive "authority" in the way I speak/write (or others here for that matter) it is self-confidence because we believe TE Ethics is owned by us, and we invite every newcomer to develop that self-confidence...

I'd like to have a session on this... because I remember how @nic made that jump recently (not to talk about my personal experience all the time to bore people), Nic, would you like to share, how empowering it is to see and acknowledge one's alignment with the purpose of an organization.

and how difficult it is not to fall back into old pattern, "Someone give me permission pls" ( there is one book I do recommend: [https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24453082-big-magic)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24453082-big-magic)) , I fall back a lot, too.

we haven't yet solved it - but the living library is an amazing idea that this group co-created and is now laboring into becoming - with limited time - and that is a feature! It is way more valuable when done by practicing token engineers and supporters than when it would be run by full-time librarians, no? it is the beginning of a peer support system in Token Engineering knowledge exchange

[It's hard to nail down what I was thinking when I wrote that but I will try. ' Imagine you are invited to a dinner party by an acquaintance but you show up about 20 minutes late. The table is talking about politics and it is a very lively discussion, a little disjointed but you think you get the gist so you offer your opinion. To your shock the table falls silent then bust out laughing at you because when you sat down you heard a discussion about politics, but what was really going on was a discussion about a sordid tryst'. Ok I'm being dramatic, but that is what comes to mind. I appreciate all the links you provided today. I think I am starting to get it. I ordered the book 'The usefulness of useless knowledge'. The Library project is an interesting project however because I presume we want it to be useful, but we also are compelled to fill it up with useless knowledge! I'm feeling giddy trying to figure it out in my head. I love what you guys are doing in this working group!!!](about:blank#)

I started reading A Pattern Language by Christopher Alexander and the intro really called to me. I believe that we can do the same, create a pattern language for Token Engineering Parameters that genuinely solves human problems. We can also use the way each piece of the pattern is presented, in the Ecosystem Value Flows course, the way we structure findings from focus groups/research, and in the structure of the library (eg the problem this petal of the crypto-economic flower solves, how it solves it, how it relates to the other petals of the flower in solving problems). The reason why I believe that we could create a pattern language for TE, is that we are essentially building digital representations of physical structures designed for collectives, so digital cities. I see web3 as an experimentation and exploration, to improve the current physical structures. For example when we look at a pattern like Fruit Trees, maybe it represents a mechanism where people invest time and resources in, but it bears fruit that people can benefit from for a long time, by picking the fruit and eating right away, without a need for cooking(which uses energy), so maybe its digital representation is a mechanism that gives them energy right away, surpassing the need of using money to purchase that which gives them energy. These quotes in particular called to me: (edited)

this would be fantastic, just be aware that these type of patterns have not yet emerged in token networks in the wild out there. I believe there is a reason for that: the intention with which these networks are designed. So my suggestion would be to "dogfood it" here in 0mega first: we have a petri-dish of extremely intentional token engineers, practitioners, participants here, we create value together , can capture and share that value (it does not need its own token, we can use TEC or any combi of tokens that already float around in TE ecosystem- the incentive mechanism design and valueflow patterns are described and executed on social layer); and the goal would be "to grow organically" ( I believe next weeks intro to Dynamic Energy Budget will inspire us all)

this also very very much relates to our "Work Style" also next week - will try and update here portion of the Miro where we can see how we have organized ourselves to date in improv and what emerged from it

and when we have that working, those intentional patterns can be part of the no-code suite; this was the original idea - we can update it together (but would already be a spinoff of 0mega, likely like the library): [https://forum.tecommons.org/t/electric-circus-game-based-version-of-ecosystem-valueflows-course/393/4](https://forum.tecommons.org/t/electric-circus-game-based-version-of-ecosystem-valueflows-course/393/4)

Hi @Solsista, Sure. I‚Äôll keep it short first. I am helping to build 2 organisations basically. One is Perspectiva, which is the mothership, and the other is called Emerge. A social movement-building initiative aimed at working on the social dimension of what we call the ‚ÄòMeta-crisis‚Äô. The TL;DR is below So I am working as senior adviser, COO,...

_20-Feb-22 05:31 AM_:
By the way @Jolly LaMa joined an impromptu hackalong with Liminal Village / Impact Pirates couple of weeks back and he's got poured some of the initial ideas how to map valueflows onto cadCAD model "UI" @Nate0909 and @nic we could use that at starting point --> but definitely as a subthread, parallel thread to here, no? As not to overwhelm, we need to support facilitators to develop the TE Ethics Practice sessions in 0mega first, and get the word out on those first; same/similar with the library, first content then comms; and once those start running smoothly we can move to this ... or maybe, really in parallel, since we have Nate and Justin as new additions, and let's see where Dave is drawn to

_20-Feb-22 06:54 AM_:

So here is an overview /prep for Work Style Session on Wednesday: what emerged during our 10month improv :

![https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/810180622634844202/944925000232763422/unknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/810180622634844202/944925000232763422/unknown.png)

<img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f499.png" width=50 height=50>

I would say we're now in phase of creating content from the discovery work done; we need comms and the administrative work that needs to be done to actually get funding from TEC

A good preparation will be how much and where you have contributed, whether work is completed or still ongoing, what you need to accomplish it; and then think about whether there's time, energy, resources to add any more work at the moment or when or what can be shuffled around so you can have your cake and eat it too

<img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f609.png" width=50 height=50>

there's an alchemy of minting time, when "backlog" isn't grromed as a pipeline, but actually more stirred like primordial soup of potential - I dare to say not many have figured it out yet

here is a nice depiction of "problem space" of backlog:

![https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/810180622634844202/944927061838004254/unknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/810180622634844202/944927061838004254/unknown.png)

I'd very much encourage everyone here to adhere to the principle of creativity or principle of potentials and pattern matching (with their other activities, be it day job or other collaborative work done with other DAOs etc.) to shift the mind from "problem space" to "potential space"

<img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f4af.png" width=50 height=50>

those who have contributed will be asked to locate their experience in this matrix:

hopefully we'll have @durgadas and @Jeremy&TheGospelOfChange who are experienced facilitators with this to help with questions, but I trust many of us has the capability, so please read through this facilitations technique before Wednesday

The newcomers could also contribute valuable insights wrt were they could or want to contribute, and how they would locate those areas as simple? complicated? complex? chaotic?

participating in weekly calls to get the beat is also work!

^^this is mainly inspired by contributions from @nic @Jolly LaMa and @Technoshaman among many of course

" a deep hanging out" .. thank you @stef will add it

I had thought I'd be M.I.A. in other project todos but these signals you shared moved me a lot... I think now is all out of my system for now ... I wanted to share to reflect on @nic's questions beginning of last week: "what energizes us"? "how do we economize with that energy?" "what energy do we bring into our relationships and systems we're building together?" (paraphrased likely

GM everybody! As you already may know I'm part of Metagame and I have been very delighted to see that MyMeta has been part of the Consilience Library roadmap. In Metagame we have been trying to focus our efforts into better integratability for MyMeta and providing value to other DAOs who might find it of great use. Given @solsista's remarks during the Proposal Inverter presentation in 0mega on how the MyMeta could be used for something more than just "showing off", I would like to hear some feedback from the rest of you about how MyMeta could best serve the goals of the TE Library project (and later on maybe expand this to proposals). Also in case ou didn't know, MyMeta is being overhauled and the profile now run through Ceramic! This means that you connect to MyMeta directly with your decentralized identity and all data from all other interaction flow right to your MyMeta profile. I have one question for you. Will the library be housed in Notion permanently, or is this a temporary solution? This is imporant becaus Notion is neither open-source, nor web3 integradable and if you wish for suggestions based on profile data to be used seemlessly and securely, Notion would make things difficult. But it is easy to take the whole Notion format and host it in your own platform. Or we could load all Notion data in our own OS? We could do a test run and see! Let me know what your thoughts are! @Mert Ozd @Letty @nic (edited)

@nic i have been interested in DAOs ever since THE DAO, at that time i was so green that I didn't even know how to get ETH, when i learned about bitcoin, I wasn't interested in it, got hip to smart contracts, thought interesting, then DAO, well ok this is something I want to wrestle with

i was in a small community then called divvydao

was suppose be 'toolkit' for THE DAO. i didn't know what any of this meant, but it resonated with me, and now I think I beginning to see the dim outline of that

I make digital content mainly and have a liquidity pool and I hustle, live transaction to transaction, but I want to hold this space

in which I believe you guys are holding

@durgadas was talking about mental models, this connects to the core of what I really vibing. uniswap as hyperstructures, DAOs are stewards to the hyperstructures. metalabels

[GM everybody! As you already may know I'm part of Metagame and I have been very delighted to see that MyMeta has been part of the Consilience Library roadmap. In Metagame we have been trying to focus our efforts into better integratability for MyMeta and providing value to other DAOs who might find it of great use. Given @solsista's remarks during the Proposal Inverter presentation in 0mega on how the MyMeta could be used for something more than just "showing off", I would like to hear some feedback from the rest of you about how MyMeta could best serve the goals of the TE Library project (and later on maybe expand this to proposals). Also in case ou didn't know, MyMeta is being overhauled and the profile now run through Ceramic! This means that you connect to MyMeta directly with your decentralized identity and all data from all other interaction flow right to your MyMeta profile. I have one question for you. Will the library be housed in Notion permanently, or is this a temporary solution? This is imporant becaus Notion is neither open-source, nor web3 integradable and if you wish for suggestions based on profile data to be used seemlessly and securely, Notion would make things difficult. But it is easy to take the whole Notion format and host it in your own platform. Or we could load all Notion data in our own OS? We could do a test run and see! Let me know what your thoughts are! @Mert Ozd @Letty @nic  (edited)](about:blank#)

I realized for the TE Ethics Initiative to pull through we need a lead (PM) :D, e.g. get facilitators to write an overview of the sessions they want to provide per practice session, then help with scheduling dates, getting people's interest in each session, help with sharing content before recording afterward, doing a short summery in TEC handbook (gitbook)

Token Engineering Ethical Principles (WIP)

Token Engineering Ethical Principles (WIP) These initial principles emerged through focus group and analysis in Working Group 0mega. Here we give a short description of what these principles convey. They are not prescriptive. However, facilitators in WG 0mega are preparing practice sessions for ...

I'm one of the facilitators - so that additional creative work that started, made me a super staller wrt process/progress ...interesting. Anyways, obviously happy to show the ropes and such

_23-Feb-22 04:21 PM_:

just a non-practical question (really I'm more in favor of getting this out to the people anyhow, but still I think this question is core): if we need someone to organize a group of people is that self-organization?

or the other way round: what is self-organization? what is it that we're missing that a group of 4 people can self-organize in an asynchronous (due to timezones) manner;

what changes when there is a lead?

definitely communication/information flow changes

leads typically help one break things down into smaller steps when they realize people are having trouble making progress, or try and figure out what else... so some sort of a self-coaching maybe; or little incentives along the way, gamification a reminders system...

yes in self-organization the communication must increase - we shall have threads per initiative! and every work area for that matter...

As children know, sometimes boxes are very difficult to get out of. Why is it any different for us? Between glass ceilings, dirt floors, and boxes,

*we need to know that a bottom up approach is not only an approach that starts from somewhere that we believe to be the bottom but an approach that was painted by several painters throughout the ages that led us to to understand where can we be sometime in the future from now*

. And I can guarantee you, you will move at least 20 feet within the next hour. I can guarantee you that, and I have algorithms that can define and predict that-- utilizing movement prediction patterns, hair follicle samples that have been taken throughout the entire time that you've been here, and, of course, the common spectral analysis. Now, we know that everything here is an illusion ‚ú® and that we are somewhere else

<img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f440.png" width=50 height=50>

. But the cool thing about that is it feels pretty real. I mean, you know what I mean? Like, it's pretty convincing. So big credit to those people working hard there.

>

I think that's important to realize. **Every person in the world around you is really good at something**. You know what I mean? So if this is the sample-- you know, here in this situation-- it's kind of a special situation-- but if you go out in the world, all around you, constantly, there are amazing people. And you'll never know, unless they have a badge on. **But you'll never know unless you ask them.**

I think we should have @durgadasand others who are good at this have "complexity tolerance" onboarding 1:1s with people, what do newcomers think? and of course we shall have a budget for that such that to enable such guide to be able to make the time

(btw I don't think that such guides can be trained by 0mega coursework or so, but self-select over time... like @nic for example)

and we'll have TE trouble makers like myself who won't let anyone settle for the simple straight "solution" but encourage to search inside fo the ingenuity that every human posesses (even if those trouble makers still have themselves trouble to to articulate what the alternative is , we can point away from the simple repetitive transactional receipes that end up in the same mess over and over - only faster now) (edited)

this is exactly the justification that relentless CEOs like Jeff Bezos use (and are proud of, check out www.relentless.com) (edited)

If the law or code allows for it - or even cannot prevent you from causing harm - are you legit to cause harm?

do we also need to define moral and ethics in the context of Token Engineering? "Ethicists today, however, use the terms interchangeably. If they do want to differentiate morality from ethics, the onus is on the ethicist to state the definitions of both terms. Ultimately, the distinction between the two is as substantial as a line drawn in the sand." or just make a distinction that there is personal view and community view [https://www.britannica.com/story/whats-the-difference-between-morality-and-ethics](https://www.britannica.com/story/whats-the-difference-between-morality-and-ethics)

which relates to of course not only token engineering: "AT THE HEART of the Ukraine crisis lies a fundamental question about the nature of history and the nature of humanity: is change possible?

_24-Feb-22 04:51 AM_:

and back to the original questions of Yuval... does anyone really believe that "tokens can change the way humans behave"?

or even if, whether that would be a sustainable change or a simple quick fix (again assuming that tokens (incentive mechanism design) can change human behavior)

and that presumes we know how to engineer those incentives to change human behavior "for good"... and this is where I definitely check out: we do not and cannot know - that's why TEC set out to let participants define the parameters, assuming that proposals and bounties is going to advance Token Engineering - again, I can peacefully check out double: and as Jeanne also explained yesterday: this is not how knowledge is created, and is being funded with the wrong mechanisms - still even in TEC

so seeing that it is our job to find better mechanisms, proposal inverter also points to that direction, but still very mechanistic

will Dynamic Energy Budget work? let's bring on our ingenuity

...so this whole workstyle/funding (acknowledging priceless incentives that keep people up at night that cannot be conceptualized, measured, or rewarded) is a new workstream... who is in?

_24-Feb-22 05:19 AM_:

I believe applying for short-term funds is a provably wrong assumptions to advance knowledge, TE or otherwise, as a public good ...one might try to argue, but for TE Ethics it is definitely wrong, so this define milestones and get funds won't create the right environment - but that is the membrane of current experiment/iteration in TEC... so a solution will be (a) behave as the system incentivizes (proposal, milestones, hoops etc., tricklingly small funds) (b) redefine how value flows within 0mega according to what want to incentivize: freedom and a safe space to explore TE Ethics from a practitioners (engineer as well as other participants) perspective; integrate in their daily practice and share feedback with others (instead of only participating in focus groups... so again this points to a more peer/mentor-based approach as @Jolly LaMa pointing to)

"Quantum mechanics differs from classical physics in that energy, momentum, angular momentum, and other quantities of a bound system are restricted to discrete values (quantization), objects have characteristics of both particles and waves (wave‚Äìparticle duality), and there are limits to how accurately the value of a physical quantity can be predicted prior to its measurement, given a complete set of initial conditions (the uncertainty principle).

*And then you read in Plato somewhere, the soul is a circle. I suppose the circle represents. totality. Within the circle is one thing, it is encircled, it‚Äôs enframed. That would be the spatial aspect, but the temporal aspect of the circle is, you leave, go somewhere and come back, the alpha and omega. God is the alpha and omega, the source and the end. Somehow the circle suggests immediately a completed totality, whether in time or in space. [JOSEPH CAMPBELL]*

Knee deep in the abyss, waiting on the muse I need to think a spell [this might take a while] Pulled the Cosmic Trigger and now the abyss is pullin souls left and right, up and down Those people who know my mind best I can't keep losing you, I can't keep losing those that I can truly talk to those that don't know how much they touched my soul...

for another project I work on... this got me back here actually with those questions, and was listening to sth @Jolly LaMa shared

what token engineering effectively can do is "retooling the motivations that underlie decision-making" - we can't "make people do things" nor are we legit to think we can - but we can retool the motivations... mind and mental models being the most effective tools enable systems change

when I was prepping the community update today, I chose this link about Dynamic Energy Budget, after looking for "somatic maintenance" [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance_of_an_organism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintenance_of_an_organism)

Maintenance of an organism

Maintenance of an organism is the collection of processes to stay alive, excluding production processes. The Dynamic Energy Budget theory delineates two classes Somatic maintenance mainly comprises the turnover of structural mass (mainly proteins) and the maintenance of concentration gradients of metabolites across membranes (e.g., counteractin...

it talks about hybneration... and of course there's death <-- this made me think of a more natural way for thinking about and hence handling "backlog"

I wanted to propose something for the Library. Not sure if this injects to much structure but to me it seems we need to develop a method of categorizing potential library submissions. I put the cryptoflower into a matrix so we could label any submissions bases on what disciplines the article submitter believed the article is related to. I also added an example of how we might apply this to the google doc [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GwTiq1RcRfnDrr-Po8BbWVpOxl0b9gD1emjmgqIJDy4/edit#](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GwTiq1RcRfnDrr-Po8BbWVpOxl0b9gD1emjmgqIJDy4/edit#) Another useful output from attempting to label or tag content as related to the cryptoflower is that we may discover that the flower needs added pedals.

oh btw @stef I just realize I do feel absolute resistance and frustration wrt the whole "propose to get funded" (but buy TEC first, go on to voter mobilization, wait for Conviction levels to rise,...OMG there's a bug, DM everyone to vote on the this proposal about Ethics which is postulated to be the starting point - the alpha - of TEC,...)

and definitely these arise from a lack of incentives (literally I've been funding TE since 2018... I would need to sit down and write proposals the next year to just get back what I invested; the "augmentation with proposals" totally breaks my incentive, + what I make as TE is 10x the "salary of a steward") is and resources (time, social skills...)

_25-Feb-22 07:06 AM_:

so I started with the analysis of our session, and this is the insight from the first exercise already: I'm humbled by the potential of 0mega ‚ù§Ô∏è no "single-minded focus or vision" can create this:

Finding unity in diversity requires generating your own vision, action plan, self-learning, intrinsic motivation, resourcefulness - and sharing it with the others; which leads to telescope vision (all of a sudden you can see around corners!), you dance and improvise following your own lead or someone else's or take the freedom to be still depending on your energy levels, when you ‚Äúteach‚Äù what you just learned you not only deepen your own learning but also build meaningful relationships and an environment for peer learning, when you share your resourcefulness with others by intrinsic motivation you create abundance in the world. Token engineers are here to make the tools for this.

It seems that people are talking about intersubjectivity more and more and I would like to offer some elaboration on the notion because there incredible depth to it.

@UniPuff üúêüêô "Contextual intelligence is about expanding our understanding of ‚Äì and capacity to address ‚Äì the contexts shaping the situations we face. It‚Äôs also about how context influences our ability to actually do that. Ideally we‚Äôd be in contexts, conversations, societies that help us transcend our individual and shared assumptions and blind spots so that we can more clearly see the Big Picture we‚Äôre immersed in. To the extent we can do that, we‚Äôll be wise and co-intelligent. There are things we can do to increase that capacity ‚Äì but even just knowing that such an intelligence exists helps us pay attention to what‚Äôs important." -Tom Atlee

i just read that today, and for me its web3 is a fork in legacy "superstructures" which web2 is set in a 'mindset' that we all each individually and collectively via this new liberated connectivity on all 'stacks' of what we call consensus 'reality'. (I am better at poetry)

but something like Consilience Library can be say an index to what the landscape is, should and could be (edited)

a way to be in the center of the cryptoeconomic flower, so that we can better resonance with 'healthy' growth

so that we can 'soft' bend the whole of web3 towards *the ethos of and ethics* in token engineering

Pulling The Cosmic Trigger with Rushkoff

Douglas Rushkoff started us off in the Fetal position. This lil joke was sparked when Doug was curious about curryhobo's creative studio and trying to make sense of a blank space in his background. In this No. 1 clip from Pulling The Cosmic Trigger with Rushkoff, I got inspired by the things Doug said and what curry drew. So I pulled on my ally...

‚ÄòThey Get Fired All the Time. And They Have No Idea Why.‚Äô

Pop culture lionizes the dazzling brilliance of money managers on the autism spectrum. Reality rarely measures up.

not quite sure what I am getting at yet, I just know this dimension is part of the Transdisciplinary Art of Token Engineering

and somehow that "Inner Game of Token Engineering", the inquiry as to what motivation is, what self is that shall do the self-organization, and also the liberation of understanding that we do not control but dance with dynamic adaptive systems (and of course the support of many beautiful minds) helped me grow immensely during the past year..

if you can please do add your tasks/activities of the past months into these simple-complicated-complex-chaotic matrices; if you did only 1-2 things it's also good, if you've been participating only in WG calls ,also place your post-it to let us know how it feels when you drop into an 0mega call like this...

it is really about finding a cluster for each type of task and in each cluster using the appropriate tools and processes

I love this btw:

_02-Mar-22 04:20 PM_:

that is it, and it has to do with where intrinsic motivations are formed... and also a little important insight I have, rereading this: it is "teach them" not "tell them" ... that was my biggest learning as well.... and here in 0mega we're very much intent on making it a *peer* learning experience...

I think this is why I want to teach a bot

i want to toss the ballon

to see if it has natural rhythm

because if we can't do that, then the bots are not a eco-system friendly design

is my best guest right now

I'm in orbit of it somehow

because i can toss a ballon to myself

thats over time gets me in a strange loop

not Infinite Game

do then think, towards infinite game,

check out #deleted-channel the play yesterday, helped a lot!

Working Styles depending on structure of the landscape we're feeling our feet on:

Play to move from chaotic to complex

Dance to move from complex to complicated

Use your token engineering toolbelt to move from complicated to clear (if you are a token network participant, tandem with a TE)

Up your inner game of TE with the inifite play at TEC#0mega

_03-Mar-22 10:32 AM_:

yes!

why TEC

if your web3 concept is too chaotic

we give you space to pull that idea into an action plan

and a community of curious bees

that will help in small but invaluable ways

that your seed has the best chance to grow in the wild landscape of web3

but we got some file Xs so don't sleep on 0mega group at least thats the word on the street

we like to frame the process as co-creative

but really we all like to really play with infinite games and we are curious to see what infinite game you have inside of you...

"sense-analyse-respond" ...this is this model- and data-driven optimization once we agree on the *adjacent possible as the "outcome"* results in governing constraints

"sense-categorize-respond"... once we deploy our "simple rules" that these archaic world computers can run, we get on-chain data of how participants do respond, cold (token activity) and warm data (forum posts, chats, emojis, ...) can categorize if we move towards the adjacent possible? great! away from it? wait don't panic, maybe we have found an even higher local maximum... let's look around first. Have we lost sight? the adjacent possible we thought was worth optimizing for has pushed us over the edge into the chaotic?

be still. listen. maybe you already hear the beat and can start dancing? If not, play

it's an infinite game anyway, we do not play to win, not for power nor status, nor amassing tokens

we play to play

act

there's no effective constraint anyway

what do you sense?

_03-Mar-22 12:20 PM_:

it depends what "sense" means ... I used to be the opinion that not even apriori knowledge (i.e. model) should be used, only multi-dimensional data from any sensors

only until I realized we have been sensing data from the shadows in the cave...

so when we say "sense-making" specifically by hosting multiple worldviews, without judging any view for more expansive or less developed ... then we're getting closer to the exit...

it's diametrical to artificial intelligence

<img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f604.png" width=50 height=50>

- not emotional intelligence - either (I still have to get empathy and compassion... it should not be suffering together...)

organic intelligence?

yes in that sense it is very pioneering

but "analysis" puts it back into something useful.. we need concepts and models to be effective, to take action, no?

action in inaction (also still don't quite get)

it was so interesting how @ygg_anderson riffed of from the 0mega update, wrt "play and dance", he mentioned what an AI researcher said: "If you want progress, build playgrounds"

so whilst now hitchhiking with MotionDAO, I learnt about "embodied practices" "embodied intelligence"... and when you google you find these:

Embodied Intelligence: AI that Touches the World

Most people think of intelligence as existing in the computer or our brain. Artificial intelligence recognizes faces, understands speech, picks movies, and corrects typos. These tasks are well-suited for computers. But when it comes to roboticists, they are all about physical tasks in the real world. And, intelligence is no longer is confined ...

![https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DPDOltQei9s/maxresdefault.jpg](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DPDOltQei9s/maxresdefault.jpg)

think about this: we are creating better environments for computers to learn than for humans to thrive

in web3 we want humans to pick up bounties for fiat tokens, "make them do things"

as a super power....

"‚ÄúJust leaving the rational mind to itself, it will tend to maximize towards efficacy & power, without requiring the wisdom as to what to do with that power.‚Äù"

What Does It Mean To Be Fully Human?

(Self) Isolation has its advantages & disadvantages In times like this, we have space and time to ask ourselves important questions. What does it mean to be fully human? What is it that I really want out of life? What Does It Mean To Be Apart of The Lineage of All of Life?

we nwe had started the te-philosophy channel I got some really concerned feedback that Philosophy... without subject matter expertise, it's a hard one to pull off

that was when the iron curtain lifted fully! there are interests in academia (it's a money making business, and if not it's a status business!) that cannot allow for such things to happen ....and then because they try and manage something that is abundant... we end up in bankruptcy!

philosophical bankruptcy

philosophy is the favorite pass time acticity we have as teenagers and only stop because someone tells us to study and get a grade or a job... here's to the ones' that never stop

every token economy participant is allowed to ask and answer these philosophical questions before and during their ride on a token ship

and as humans we are all invited to do the same on spaceship earth

philosophize away! take back the knowledge :))

_04-Mar-22 03:36 AM_:

have a look at the mandala pls... does it reflect? it should have 3-4 main notes at each quarter, maybe we can breakdown "TE Ecosystem" into 3-4 adjacent possible connections, e.g. PrimeDAO, MotionDAO (dance), LiminalDAO (play), DADAO/IE... would be my suggestion as we have very close connections to those... However, if we can handle more you are active in other communities, who will appreciate the emergent learning from here... also there are non-DAOs like LTF we already have close connections with... important for focusing on would be applied token engineering happening, such that we can strengthen the "Experiential" emergent learning part...

minus the word "employees"

- self-organization makes each one of us into CEOs... chief everything officers

jk... but it definitely makes us into investors

it's not a capability that you need to have ... it's a mindset shift that you need to have

I'm learning to do the most mundane tasks... like a boss

<img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f609.png" width=50 height=50>

and all of a sudden I see "mundane" is a concept that isn't life affirming... there is nothing mundane about how my hands coordinate to wash themselves under running water that comes out of an amazing engineering spectacle of our water system, which ...

the mind shifts from what I think other people think of the work I do to ... stop mind

that's how you flow

whatever yo do or not do

when I read "To do is to be" ... I immediately brought "my series of doing" to an end. Only to realize after turbulent waves to surf... I did not know how to be...

So 0mega can be that space where you can move from aporetic to aware safely, with a community that is here to help build capacity

a community of life affirming algorithmic policy makers... that's the vision of TE

"And it is precisely our highly trained capacity to combine physical with mental thinking that makes dance not only possible but powerful."

_04-Mar-22 04:12 AM_:

the only sane reaction to this, imv, is deep rest ... to let your synapses space to untangle from the "learnt behaviors", depression is a natural step on the way, and the severity of it depends on the dissonance of learnt behaviors between natural self. In HF-ASD (where as I obviously disagree with the term "disorder", it really depends on your organizing principles) the dissonance is pretty big, but so is the resilience to actually appreciate the journey...

hmmm... I think I am writing this note, for @Juankbell as I heard yesterday at community update call, you wanted to venture into these realms: please be aware that people are not machines that can or shoul be fixed, but these are all natural processes. And if you are aware of this very delicate realm, then I just wanted to thank you for it and for taking it up!

[I started reading A Pattern Language by Christopher Alexander and the intro really called to me. I believe that we can do the same, create a pattern language for Token Engineering Parameters that genuinely solves human problems. We can also use the way each piece of the pattern is presented, in the Ecosystem Value Flows course, the way we structure findings from focus groups/research, and in the structure of the library (eg the problem this petal of the crypto-economic flower solves, how it solves it, how it relates to the other petals of the flower in solving problems). The reason why I believe that we could create a pattern language for TE, is that we are essentially building digital representations of physical structures designed for collectives, so digital cities. I see web3 as an experimentation and exploration, to improve the current physical structures. For example when we look at a pattern like Fruit Trees, maybe it represents a mechanism where people invest time and resources in, but it bears fruit that people can benefit from for a long time, by picking the fruit and eating right away, without a need for cooking(which uses energy), so maybe its digital representation is a mechanism that gives them energy right away, surpassing the need of using money to purchase that which gives them energy. These quotes in particular called to me:  (edited)](about:blank#)

see imaginarium is for everyone and anyone poetics = imaginarium but satori plays trick and uses Infinite Imaginarium and few really did want to believe so satori put on a show and a few more come and that was good but he got bored so what the new game and the learn and remix and learned and worked and worked poetry is literally blood on the streets then he went to his few master that he knew and wanted to feel what they feel and its got stronger but tooo long and no one came along

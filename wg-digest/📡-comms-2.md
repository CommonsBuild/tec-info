Hi everyone, Nate and I had a meeting discussing the Content and Distribution Strategy. Here are the notes from our call. We will discuss it tomorrow on the weekly sync. **Content Distribution Strategy Meeting (Nate/Marko)** • Using Zenhub board in a brand new repo with established content distribution lifecycle (pipeline) [https://github.com/TECommons/content-distribution#workspaces/tec-content-production-and-distribution-60549332d7d741001bbea827/board?repos=349409011](https://github.com/TECommons/content-distribution#workspaces/tec-content-production-and-distribution-60549332d7d741001bbea827/board?repos=349409011) • Allow both internal and external contributors to easily submit Ideas and Requests for content distribution. Create a link that automatically opens New Issue on the board with a pre-defined template (issue template draft already created) • Medium, Telegram, Forum, Discord (set up bots in between) Need to figure out who will build bots, whomanages them and how to propose edits whenever we need to address CD strategy Who runs the bots? We want to propose a change. Where can we do that? / ask VyVy and Kris • Medium: feature other projects within the TE community to publish on our platform and engage others to come to TE community • Decide on a central place where all our resources and information can be found with instructions on how to do something (Gitbook, special page on our website, can be public and pass protected for internal resources) • We will need to have a person to PM the CD process, Nate volunteer to take it for starters but… • We need to think how to scale regular contributors!

Hi folks

<img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f44b.png" width=50 height=50>

I am working with @ygg_anderson to kick off a beginner/foundational cadCAD study group for the TEC labs series starting April 2nd. The plan is to go through the cadCAD bootcamp material and have at least one guest demo/QA from the cadCAD academy instructors (maybe hold a session on an advanced topic aka "cadCAD hacks"). I did reach out to @iviangita for help (thanks!!

<img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f64f.png" width=50 height=50>

) but would also like to share out with the wider comms group. The plan is to kick off April 2nd and it would be awesome to have a TEC tweet at the end of this week so we can build some ✨ hype ✨ I have conflicting meetings during the comms call but I'll try to catch the last few minutes.

Thanks for the info @blairv If you already notified @iviangita then it should be included in our Tweet schedule. Wondering if the output of the session could be a roundup blog post or something that we can publish afterwards? If so, would you be interested in supporting this?

_23-Mar-21 04:12 PM_:

I think the best way is for Issue Creators to engage the community on the pieces they need created. (Possibly create a separate template -- one for WG needs, and another for unsolicited ideas) For those with a blog post idea, such as the example you posted, it would fall on the responsibility of the PM or the Stewards to engage with the idea creator. I think possibly linking some contacts (PM, Stewards, etc) within the template would be helpful. At the end of the template: "Once your issue is posted, please notify {Insert Contact Links}"

Hey @metaverde since you were not on the call we couldn't discuss this matter and we're missing the context on this. Can you please clarify who's working on this? Is there an issue open for this interactive infographic for TEC Working Groups? I'd LOVE to have this build in as part of our website, also followed our brand guidelines. How should we proceed with this? Thanks!

_18-Apr-21 05:59 AM_:

Great feedback! - ✅ Typos - ✅ Aligned buttons. As long as we keep the texts same number of lines we are good. - Button links. Yeah, the call to actions are a bit vague. Mostly, we would like to push for the join page I guess? Adding to your ideas, how about this, from top to bottom: 1. JOIN US (/join) 2. JOIN THE MISSION (/join) 3. BUILD WITH US (github) 4. JOIN THE COMMUNITY (forum) 5. ~~JOIN THE ECOSYSTEM~~ <- to vague, remove

@kristofer LOVELY! Content was prepared by @mitch (🍔, 🍔) so I believe it's good! Discord link should go to @Vyvy-vi new Discord login. On the Homepage (Index page as you refer) I would link ALL yellow CTA's to this new Join page.

_19-Apr-21 06:58 AM_:

Yes, the flow works great @Vyvy-vi ! Some more details: - The white text uses wrong typeface, due to misspelling ("Bai jumjuree") - The button shown after login uses wrong typeface and is not uppercase - There is a border around the button that can be removed I think we should consider adding a descriptive text beneath the white header. Something like: "In order to keep our Discord server a bot- and spamfree zone, you need to first login with your Discord credentials and prove your humanity."

Since we moved on from the topic, here's something I was thinking about wrt to the Platform credential security- Perhaps, we could enable 2FA verification for anyone who's a server admin, and anyone having moderation power(in order to protect the server, when someone's credentials get compromised)?

I think this question started in Comms with me... I have two things going on. One is we're creating a streaming news channel at Metagame and would like feedback on what you all would like to see on streaming news as well as would you be interested in a streaming news station? The idea is to start there'd be a lot of repeat material and material from across the DAOosphere, then as each DAO creates its own material it can substitute that into their own stream. **The second is** we're putting together a social event showcasing the various DAOs' *educational offerings*, including interviews about the DAOs' educational philosophies. I'm not sure how to organize this yet. (edited)

_14-Jun-21 10:40 PM_:

We have discussed it. I put in a request for the link to be changed on the official website. The Homepage links to the correct Medium (token-engineering-commons), while the "Join the Ecosystem" Page on our website points to the wrong one (tecommons). Thanks for pointing that out, and I will make another request to change that link to the correct page.

_14-Jun-21 11:01 PM_:

I would also advise that we not author from the old account (te-commons) and DEACTIVATE the account. This will allow the articles to remain a part of the publication (i believe). @Craig could we test this out? If not we should at minimum remove '@tecommons' as an editor in the publication (can only be done by owner...not sure who that is). Honestly, our hesitation in the beginning was because we had limited content and didn't want the 10 articles authored (all bi-weekly updates) to be removed. I think the best course of action would be to de-activate and leave it that way for another 3 months or so, and then delete the account altogether. It's been a bigger hassle than its worth in my opinion. Would love to hear your thoughts as well.

_15-Jun-21 10:16 AM_:

We can try to DEACTIVATE, but I believe the token-engineering-commons is a publication page that belongs to the tecommons acct, aka tecommons is the owner as far as i know. i did not set it up. think was jessica. my understanding was a publication has to have an owner. so to DEACTIVATE, the publication would need another owner acct. granted it was a few months back that i briefly looked into it. during that time, i also fiddled with removing tecommons as a publication editor while signed in with tecommons acct, but it would not allow me to change permissions. assuming that denial related to the owner issue. i haven't been active in medium since @Suga took over pq blog. perhaps she has some insights?

weekly playlist recommendation (sent to and re-recommded by griff!) - such great music for focused working... just the right amount of repetition with live instruments to keep it interesting. the lyrics easily flow into the background. overall great vibe

Onboarding happens when one steward nominates a community member to become a steward and has the approval of at least 2 other stewards and no blocks during a week. If a block happens, the nomination is suspended and Gravity will mediate a dialogue to solve the issue and either continue with the nomination or drop it. Responsibilities: to act in alignment with the TEC agreements, mission, vision, values and code of conduct.

Hey fam - sorry I can't make it to the comms call today - it's overlapping with another important call for me... but I wanted to say, I helped a few people get into the Hatch and now have had some reach out to me asking if they should now "ragequit TECH" since that is what the button says on the hatch.tecommons.org I think would be really good and important to write a blogpost like "So you joined the Hatch - now what?" Explaining: - what is ragequit - what we are working on now (the CCD) - what to expect... helping to design the economy and voting with TECH We have a lot of people who joined the hatch who aren't super duper IN on what we've been up to, so I think this kind of summary is important to do asap.

OK. @poapxyz could really transform DAO engagement. I was on the [https://t.co/C1sLEKShBt](https://t.co/C1sLEKShBt) site and saw that one of the items in the POAP gallergy was a token for participating in the @tecmns Hatch.

Absolutely. Some eps are better than others but if you jump around and find topics that resonate, you should garner some good insights from their conversations and guests.

[hello  , Tam suggested I reach out to get some advice on an idea I have and also discuss a github issue with you lovely people. What's the best way to go about it? Should I just type it out on here,or would it be better if I joined a call, or sync with anyone specifically?](about:blank#)

I came across this intriguing article. [https://medium.com/@molochmystics/molochv3-8eb732cd0930](https://medium.com/@molochmystics/molochv3-8eb732cd0930) Looks like some powerful new dao tooling is coming out from the meta-cartel folks. (edited)

Baal for Guilds

To summarize: Baal is a minimalist template for Moloch DAOs borne out of the need of current MolochV2 guilds, such as MetaCartel, Raid Guild and LexDAO.

I thought the emergent Comms dao might find the article useful

I had an idea for a fun tweet series we could do sometime. It is meant to be light-hearted and comical Or even just a couple tweets or something. It starts with this: "You might be a token engineer if..." and we come up with a bunch of funny endings. For example "...if you care more about the way money works than earning it." woka woka woka!

and You might be a token engineer if....your idea of a hot date is analyzing the national budget data from 1972! (edited)

This would be a great follow-up to a heavy tweet or series. (edited)

We should get lots of engagement with funny comments too, that also finish the sentence. Just a thought...what do folks think? (edited)

Livi I have a question for you, would it have been acceptable if instead of "Other Projects" I labelled a different thing? Like, web2, Evil Corporations, or even Moloch? Or is it the idea about competition which is undesirable. I want to understand your thoughts and feelings about this so I can accommodate with our Twitter. Please don't interpret this as arguing against your suggestion

<img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f49b.png" width=50 height=50>

that’s a really great question. I’m not a fan of competition in general but I don’t think I would feel bothered if this was talking about evil Corp. moloch would be a good joke but would only work for people that understand their voting strategies and maybe would cause more harm than good for assuming our community is aware of something?

Hey guys, I'm new to this community. I lead marketing and strategy at LTF and was encouraged by @ygg_anderson to hop into the comms call on Tuesday. I really enjoyed the call and also appreciated @liviade's feedback. It made me think. I can see how "us vs. them" humour can come across as antagonistic, but there are other ways to introduce fun memes and humour into comms. For example, you could choose a theme of "we appreciate every single voter" and use a meme/image that plays on that appreciation theme. This would be a more "benign" way of getting the message across and still keeping it fun and light.

Just found this on Google search, as an example

could replace "appreciation" with "voter turnout" or similar

I think it would be interesting to come up with new designs (but sticking to the same color palette, etc.) since we've been using these existing templates for a while now and maybe new designs can get more attention. Probably what we need is a branding kit that specifies typography, color palette and theme that we want to use across all our graphics and have a standard look and feel but not necessarily templates (edited)

found this on Muzli today [https://s.muz.li/MjA1ZWRmOWJh](https://s.muz.li/MjA1ZWRmOWJh) How they offer their services (through the purchase of NFTs) is pretty much how I was proposing it be done through my dashboard idea. Except, all of it will be done within the dashboard vs on opensea, and clients can purchase services directly with their TEC tokens. Another difference is that instead of just a simple mailto: for contacting the agency, the dashboard will have an onboarding questionnaire so that comms can immediately know how to help the client.

I loved the presentation and the project @chuygarcia.eth

<img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f4af.png" width=50 height=50>

Can I help you in promoting this project in the TEC homepage so that Token Engineers and Contributors know that this is something they can make use of/take part of? Can I also help you with the client onboarding process and also contributor onboarding process specific to the comms dao? I'm hoping to refine the dashboard idea and make sure it suits this group's needs

Maybe in the future we can be like daohaus. There could be multiple daos within the TEC and maybe even competing daos for Token Engineering Clients we onboard within the TEC, with clients paying for services using TEC tokens

Anyone from Comms, just to bring to your attention, the Optimism RetroPGF vote is ongoing until Nov 1st ie through the weekend, and we actually have a vote! I believe this is an excellent opportunity to possibly receive some funding, but more importantly, bring attention to the TEC, while underlining and legitimizing all the efforts that have been made here to date.

We actually now have 3 votes currently. Pretty awesome, so since there is apparently support, I'd like to at least put in the effort to try and maximize the potential return. I'm drafting something to the best of my ability, and if anyone is available at any point tonight or over the weekend for either collab drafting, or just a review and ok, that would be much appreciated.

I think DAO2DAO is an interesting area. I'm wondering which steps are being taken, either here or the wider DAO, and the interesting thing is other DAOs are also interested. Folk like DAOists, Bankless, maybe others. It's interesting because it's another variety of noob transaction, because a noob from another DAO walks through a DAO front door, and still needs to orient, find folks for directions and so on. This is my view of noob essentials ... [https://vimeo.com/646402793](https://vimeo.com/646402793)

[thread]: I also think it might be a nice visual way to describe the TEC. We're doing complex things here, so our visual representations should reflect this also.

Hello

I would love to try to implement a BOT in the Twitter feed channel

<img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f642.png" width=50 height=50>

It's a very cool bot that allows everyone to like and RT directly from Discord

Just need a green light on that

Hello everyone

<img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f60a.png" width=50 height=50>

. Like @durgadas mentioned, I am just beginning my journey in this server. I'll focus most my attention to this channel since it is my field of work. I'm a noobie when it comes to the crypto world, but plan to learn and follow more beginning now, and to begin investing - as soon as Ramp customer support helps me successfully validate myself, lul. (...the built in camera validation process was not convenient afterall)

Hi everyone, I have been around observing the TEC discord. I just checked out the zenhub sprint board and think I'd love to translate our content to Vietnamese.

I brief background about me: I am a Computer Science student. For web3 experiences in general and translation specifically, I am in the off season work group at ForeFront, mapping out the vision and for the next season. I am also translating and managing social media platforms for BanklessDAO

_14-Dec-21 11:41 PM_:

yeah I get it, don't worry

I've been making a few translations for another DAO for DAO builders as I figured it was the best way to learn and contribute at the same time

<img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f64c.png" width=50 height=50>

so perhaps we can be a translation team across DAOs haha

so we help people translate resources for their own languages

almost everything is in english, like always

but I want to onboard latino builders, and that means we need tools in spanish too

hopefully someone here can help us get started!

Hello everyone. Today I unfortunetly saw a Instagram Story and I had to reach out to the family involved. Their little girl is sick and I called her father and created a GIveth project for them.

hi @durgadas apologies for the ping but didn't want to dm you without being explicitly told to; my only questions were centered on Hubspot, specifically just whether you would like us to utilize the CMS? I'll teach myself the platform, but admittedly have not used it except for a few moments here and there. I found the Hubspot Academy and it seems well done and very helpful so will absorb as much of that as i can before asking you any subject matter questions. I think you said typeform configuration was a priority for you as well? That's all, thank you =)

_11-Jan-22 01:43 PM_:

I've used it a lot and been in many meetings to explain this up to now, including yesterday's Hubspot meeting

Typeform should NOT be used, unless we connect it to Hubspot. Same with SurveyMonkey, etc.

_12-Jan-22 06:52 PM_:

This is our Twitter group right? I've now completed the first two Scaffold-Eth challenges and only three are publicized so far... They aren't onerous. I really believe anyone can do simple-nft-challenge-0. It will make you feel powerful and give you a plus 800 better understanding of what developers do.

We need to promote the Labs and get people here learning.

Staking app/challenge-1 actually requires coding, and tbh none of the published apps actually met specs, so I'm not convinced they're all passing, and it's more tricksy than it appears at first.

Hi all, after a chat with @Mount Manu I thought I'd introduce myself and the community I am trying to grow. The Tokenomics DAO community was created out of the need for more widespread knowledge around tokenomics. The lack of good documentation and research in the space compelled me to write articles about protocols, I found interesting ([https://tokenomicsdao.com/)](https://tokenomicsdao.com/)). This has led to a small community interested in the topic, consulting first projects on tokenomics and an idea to expand this further. We want to grow this community by creating more content and providing our expertise to others. I think there is a good overlap with what you guys do and I would like to explore how we can collaborate. As first step Manu and I thought of writing a tokenomics article about TEC.

I am voicing here and will cross-post in Stewards channel - I feel it is not appropriate to use Twitter from the voice of a "decentralized DAO/Commons" to promote proposal/objectives (be political). Will Tweets go out to urge to pass *every proposal? Notification of proposals is important to keep people up to date, but showing favoritism or saying "this is our objective" is basically saying that every person in the TEC has this perspective and wants this proposal to pass, which again, I think is not the right use of this platform. Thank you for your consideration and would love to hear feedback. (edited)

_04-Feb-22 06:12 AM_:

A clear example of "co-opting" as political scientists would put it. When factions within wider rivalrous structures appraise common resources (in this case comms channels) to lobby in their favour. I'd say this is reminiscent of the "rewards discussion" or previous dismemberment of agreements made on rewards distribution before the hatch. Just saying because the TEC as an organic structure will continue to mimic its own flaws.

Hi @JessicaZartler and thank you for raising this. It is an important point. This tweet was flagged as an issue, acknowledged and understood to be an honest mistake. The subsequent tweet about a proposal took an objective tone.

[A clear example of "co-opting" as political scientists would put it. When factions within wider rivalrous structures appraise common resources (in this case comms channels) to lobby in their favour. I'd say this is reminiscent of the "rewards discussion" or previous dismemberment of agreements made on rewards distribution before the hatch. Just saying because the TEC as an organic structure will continue to mimic its own flaws.](about:blank#)

Hi @Letty as it turns out it was nothing quite so nefarious at all. That tweet was an honest mistake and immediately acknowledged as such.

Thanks @Tam2140 It came up on my feed so I didn't see the correction. I understand and appreciate the realization. I understand how much work it is to run communications and the excitement. (edited)

While I am reflecting - I just wanted to share feedback on one more communication thread I saw - the newsletter. I was proud to see that the newsletter was sent out, I also know it was a lot to set that up! But the only information inside was about buying $TEC.. might be good to include some other news as it (to be very honest) seemed a bit spammy/focused on the $ aspect, which I know is not the case.. I know it was the first one so I am sure it's in the works - happy to support if anyone would like any input of ideas/feedback on the next newsletter

I appreciate your reflections @Letty and speaking your thoughts - it's important to always have space for critical questioning and reflections on "power dynamics" or how different voices/"factions" are represented (or not) - even though this case was not intentional - it *is a reflection (though subtle) of assumptions/mental models/culture in its own way.. glad to hear it has been discussed and acknowledged.

Yes, this mail was not ideal but it was a way to 'get started', after a long time. Because of the timing, I think everyone felt it had to be about the newly minted token, and I know I've been trying for a long time to get it out, there we some roadblocks that seemed to come up until now. I did talk about what you mentioned, even as we were making it, but there was a lot of Git R Dun in the room during that initial call and a lot of education to be done along with it, so I had to kind of make a judgment call in terms of what we could get done on that day. As it was, it was easily 4-6 hours of continuous work that day to get it out. We don't have all the bugs or initial conditions ironed out yet, either, but the basic template is there, and a lot more people know how to use the tool better than before, so on balance it's a win for us. We also got a lot of steam behind other content creation standards, etc. during that call, and subsequently, so we're headed in a good direction with that. We need more Content Creation Calendaring and production regularity and other standards to be in the hands of an already-hardworking group, so this will also take time to establish, and all of this was on the table during and since that Initial Email setup conference, including security protocols and narrative creation missing pieces we're already planning workshops and working group efforts for very soon. We've done a lot in a short time, and have planning documents like this one that came out of this as well: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JJ3YoHmWYyOH8RZs1jT8VDFyQJHt35kJw92tT7YPXvI1JJ3YoHmWYyOH8RZs1jT8VDFyQJHt35kJw92tT7YPXvI

Hi all, I've been thinking about writing something on developing "free money" as a meme. Not sure if this is an appropriate place for it but wanted to put this out in the world to see what happens. It feels a little over-engineered but this was my basic thought. The word free has a lot of different uses. We can use those different uses to create a meme that is deliberately developmental in that each level of meaning moves closer to a regen/non-rivalrous system. This meme could then serve to crypto-pill people with a variety of different viewpoints while also serving to green-pill those already in the crypto space. free - not costing or charging anything airdrops, increased yield and efficiency, asymmetric upside, creator economy, free - enjoying political independence or freedom from outside domination uncensorable, permissionless, fighting repressive regimes free - not obstructed, restricted, or impeded future states of money, what does value transfer look like without the obstructions of legacy coordination mechanisms, free to create new systems w/out imbedded growth requirement, regenerative economics, think "free love" but money, crypto-hippies bonus - free as a verb. a call to action

Got me thinking now. Is anyone experimenting with intentional open source meme development? Might be more of a multi-dao effort. If someone were to start with a short article on the general theme and explain the concept of crowdsourcing the meme development. Then solicit tweets on, for example, "what does free money mean to you?" + optionally include eth address. Compile all the responses and make that data available to anyone. Then you have a sample of collective intelligence from which anyone could create memes/art.

[dear @T.E.A.M. contributors I woke up today with severe back pain and have to get medical attention. I won't be able to show up to the syncs, however any progress would be greatly appreciated and if we could get together for tomorrow's Comms call instead that would be perfect so that we don't fall behind. Sorry for this again, I hope to feel better in the next few hours](about:blank#)

Ideas for 1Hive Radio

Since Luke introduced the 1hive radio channel I’ve been sort of brainstorming around that idea; is something that I’m particularly really interested in, so yep, wrote some stuff: Radio Programming DAOn to Earth with CurlyBracketEffect Crypto news/analysis Church hour Music events *Note: Just collected here some of the stuff that was said on ...

hey @chuygarcia.eth and all comms crew. I was chatting with @akrtws (TE Academy) on her idea to have a TE conference happening at the same time as big conferences

Chuy I know you have some good experience from organizing the DAOist

what do you think are some things we could bring to barcelona and paris now?

Thanks @liviade for bringing this up! Let me add some thoughts here: - start small asap is one option - strategically I'd rather go big, and collaborate with Ethereum Foundation from day 1, as they are hosting/supporting all the big ETH events, and I'm sure they'll be happy about this initiative - still, this would require a lot of preps work, so starting as soon as possible is great in any event (edited)

hi comms crew. the sampo working group has pulled together a high-level strategy for developing the "economic layer" of the TEC. based on feedback from the stewards call yesterday, i'm sharing it in some of the working group channels. it'd be great to get your advice on it. there's a polling tool at the end of post that you can use to provide quick/easy feedback on the plan's main points: [https://forum.tecommons.org/t/your-advice-on-the-sampo-strategy/1019](https://forum.tecommons.org/t/your-advice-on-the-sampo-strategy/1019)

Your advice on the Sampo strategy

Provide as much information as possible about your idea. This post grew from the Sampo working group’s high-level strategy document, which you can find below. The plan has gotten initial advice from the working group and was presented at last week’s Steward Council. To broaden feedback from the community, I’m posting it here and including a lin...

Hi comms, I must disagree with this tweet.

<img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f642.png" width=50 height=50>

Donating to the TEC on Giveth is

**good**

but is it really the

**best**

way to support the TEC? No, definitely not. Isn't the best way to support the TEC to buy the TEC token? Not only do you support token engineering by buying the token, but you also make an investment that might increase in value.

**Invest in token engineering - buy the TEC token!**

This message I think should be one of our main messages. The TEC is like Wikipedia, it is like Greenpeace. It is an organisation that relies on outside donations to support a cause. In the case of Greenpeace, he environment, in our case, token engineering. I think we can glean a lot of fundraising strategies and communication strategies from old organisations like those.

Hi @chuygarcia.eth - wanted to share some conversations I had over the last days: - Graph.io would be excited to support a larger Cryptoeconomics/TE gathering like we discussed, embedded in a large conference - ETHCC plans to grow the size of the conference and program, and would be happy to discuss further in Oct, when kicking of the planning for ETHCC 23 Any news on your end? Happy to discuss!

Hey @chuygarcia.eth . Working on a genesis claim project for the beez. I want to include thr TEC logo in the drop. It will have it's own nft with the artist's style.

Hey everyone. Just wondering with pinned posts in Working Groups, which now seem also to include Projects ... I can understand very new projects not having pinned posts, and can see great examples of post pinning, typically the stewards channel was a pick for me.

_12-Apr-21 11:42 AM_:

Hey @santigs @mateodaza I just created this channel so we can coordinate better on Sourcecred and its next steps :))

Do you guys think is a good time to schedule the committee call to decide the token distribution details?

I'll try to join today's call - been feeling a bit sick this week

Wanted to mention that I'm currently fixing some issue with the Github token that for some reason they updated their format and broke the sourcecred data gathering, will let you know when fixed

instance ready and up to date - also latest distribution was made ‚≠ê

Because of the repo name update now the instance link is [https://commonsbuild.github.io/tec-sourcecred/#/explorer](https://commonsbuild.github.io/tec-sourcecred/#/explorer)

I noticed some new users received zero TCRED because I didn't enabled them - will do that for next distribution (edited)

_14-Apr-21 09:57 AM_:
sourcecred/initiatives: Loads manually added contributions. Still in alpha. Is the latest, I still haven't checked how that works but seems ideal for praise

(edited)

Not sure what problems would come for being in alpha, I'll give it some time this week to test it out

As last time it was broken, but this latest update seems to work just fine! (edited)

_18-May-21 02:58 PM_:

I am so sorry for not being able to attend today's sourcecred call. I have a few updates- I implemented a version of both the ways of taking in data for sourcecred (forms, single command) and currently it seems to work alright. I'm sending a few screenshots of this. If y'all want to test it out, dm me and I can invite you to the testing server, where you can interact with that bot. (edited)

## Approach-2: Single Command

## Approach-1: Form format

Both these approaches work fine, but they both need some amount of polishing before use(once we decide on which method is more intuitive, and would be more easier to use, I could **ship it**)

*I would like to make a small correction there- We'll be storing the data on MongoDB(

[https://www.mongodb.com/)](https://www.mongodb.com/))

, but I would maybe deploy a site where mateo or anyone handling the sourcecred distribution can log in and view the data. Google Sheets haven't been used, since editing data in them can be slightly error-prone(esp. when discord bots can run concurrency issues) and because it would be harder to comply with discord's policies over there- (If we want, we can store the data in a hidden channel on discord too, but then it would be harder to manage)

_25-May-21 10:11 AM_:

The real advantage of a multi-sig is the decentralization aspect, we can set it up on gnosis so everyone in the committee is in there but we can set up a rule so we would need x persons to sign a transaction, for example: We are 5 in the gnosis safe but we set up a rule so it would only need 2 signs for a transaction to fulfill, or we can set that everyone in the safe has to sign it. I believe this is the main decision we have to make - I believe 2 signatures is enough as we are not many, but we can discuss

We then have to manually assign the amount that everyone will get related to the "grain" or TCRED accumulated in sourcecred - After that we make one transaction using [https://disperse.app/](https://disperse.app/) . I need to check if this works properly with a gnosis safe

disperse

distribute ether or tokens to multiple addresses

The other tedious part that has to be done manually is the fact of "burning" the TCRED that was dispersed to every user. That will be done one by one and I can do it looking at the spreadsheet, another person can take a look for any mistake - the interface in admin sourcecred looks like this

I'll try to make a test today or tomorrow using a multisig on disperse.app so we are sure we won't have a problem (edited)

hey all. just checking in here. sounds like we are not ready to distribute yet, and contemplating a multisig. we can mint tokens on aragon, just like IHT, if distributing something other than xdai. i have minting privileges and am currently the sole distributor of IHT, using disperse app.

_25-May-21 02:14 PM_:

probably biggest unknown is multsig with disperse. pending mateo's research. griff likely has direct experience or at least knows if gnosis compatible with disperse. tradeoffs: decentralized vs complexity seems with relatively infrequent but regular distributions, getting 2 or 3 signers should not be an issue.

aragon experts amongst us ( @mateodaza ?) just thinking out loud here. no idea if it makes any sense. we already have the system set up and utilized. if we can require multiple addresses for minting, would it serve same purpose as a separate multisig? but then distribution would still have to come from a separate address. and do we want sourcecred processes separate from other tec token generation activities?

_01-Jun-21 09:51 AM_:

Hey guys! So I did some research regarding this, excellent suggestion from Sem - We can totally do it, I checked they used the "Company" template which allows voting and tokens essentially, but the coolest part is the Agent service

![https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/831192353812381715/849283968184352778/unknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/831192353812381715/849283968184352778/unknown.png)

We could sign the disperse transaction using Frame which would be passed after a certain voting threshold

Which I find amazing! I'd suggest to do a hack session between the committee and learn while we do, it's pretty straightforward

We would have an interface like this [https://aragon.1hive.org/#/pollen/0x14ead0d03aca4e8b8f61830b71adb35e3809eb92/](https://aragon.1hive.org/#/pollen/0x14ead0d03aca4e8b8f61830b71adb35e3809eb92/) to mint and transfer tokens

I'll look out what option brings the more benefits, it's being used at 1hive so there may be a good reason for that!

Hey guys! so I did this last friday - here's all the data recollected since the beginning of our sourcecred implementation till last week. I set 10 xDAI to distribute and we can see how much everyone will get [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mpzYbCeN1cqnZwYALcagtfiNtCzUsePxJ7sWb_62FQ4/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mpzYbCeN1cqnZwYALcagtfiNtCzUsePxJ7sWb_62FQ4/edit?usp=sharing)

I'd like to see how we can automate the building of this spreadsheet, maybe Santiago knows @santigs ? After we send the funds to everyone's wallet, I'd have to do a 'burn' of the distributed tokens for each identity, this process is manual. And that's it

Guys, I posted the question to Seth (s_ben) about cred burning and they also do not have an automatic solution yet, actually Maker is doing more than 100 accounts manually.

He sugested though they might implement it in the future

he also mentioned we could do something semi-automatic ourselves so maybe we can explain the case to Sem and see if he could come out with a midway solution

Still waiting for Santiago response

Yes, true. We have address lists ranging from - all trusted seed (600+) - TS-IH verified (250+) - TS members who agreed to share their pers info with the TEC via direct email campaign (125+) CSTK performed the third bullet above because we have had privacy issues/questions regarding the sharing of ETH & email addresses. Don't know where sourcecred falls on the spectrum but worth considering if haven't already.

Here's the flow C&P from h

so this is the bot we use for pollen-related tasks [https://github.com/1Hive/pollen-bot](https://github.com/1Hive/pollen-bot) it uses a MongoDB to store user-saved information like social accounts and wallet addresses. If you just want it to store user information I think just forking and redeploying would work.

>

If you wanted the fully automated process and cred information for users, you'd need to also fork our pollen-cred-fetcher script [https://github.com/1Hive/pollen-cred-fetcher](https://github.com/1Hive/pollen-cred-fetcher) which saves cred and identities basic information from the ledger and the credGraph into MongoDB every time the SourceCred instance is updated or recalculated. You'd also need the pollen-onboarding script [https://github.com/1Hive/pollen-onboarding](https://github.com/1Hive/pollen-onboarding) which reads user information from the DB and updates the ledger, merging ids, activating them and adding wallet addresses to them every time it's executed.

>

Seems kind of overwhelming, but I think it's easy to set up. Feel free to ping me if you need help with that

External Plugin Tutorial

This is an example ExternalPlugin to show 3rd-party developers how to create one. An ExternalPlugin is code that runs outside of the SourceCred runtime and generates a WeightedGraph and other important structures, which SourceCred instances can then integrate into their Cred scores via URL or file upload. This is optional. Providing a declaratio...

@liviade suggested we meet up and discuss how we make the Reward System proposal become a reality in the near- to midterm! We need a working Reward System in place as close in time as possible to the commons upgrade. Do we integrate SourceCred with the praise system, integrate the praise system with SourceCred, build something from scratch or make do with spreadsheets, gaff tape and a better documented process? Ideally we would like to create something that solves our needs - better analytics and transparency among other things - and is "product" enough to be reused by other communities without too much of an effort. Let's look at the process from praise to payment and try to identify all moving parts, who does what, etc. See Miro ‚Äì Reward System Process:

_15-Sep-21 06:04 AM_:

Could praise be imported into SourceCred? I read up on how the SourceCred contributor graph works and made an attempt graphing some real praise data from earlier this year. These are my first thoughts: - In In order to create a qualitative praise graph we would have to create separate nodes for "the praise" and for "the contribution". From the viewpoint of SourceCred the act of praising is also a contribution that could accumulate cred. - We would have to identify all praise that references the same contribution. Otherwise the quality of the graph becomes much lower. (edited)

@hz, would this be a workable graph structure? I didn't include the weights but I imagine they would be manually estimated in the quant process and set on the edges connecting praise and contribution?

Praise always runs the risk of becoming a popularity contest, where 3 praise for one contribution gives you 3 times more cred/grain/IH than 1 praise for the same contribution.

Maybe this situation has been handled manually up to this point during praise quantification. I don't know yet but will find out, @liviade do you know?

I do like this idea, partially because I think 'Praise X for being an awesome person ' should make X feel good but not receive quantitative credit -- newcomers have no experience with X, and even veteran community members may have different ideas about how awesome X is.

@Nuggan @mateodaza You mentioned it probably is going to be difficult to feed praise data into SourceCred. I don't remember, what where the arguments? The interface seems fairly straightforward provided we can produce a "WeightedGraph" according to the SC spec.

External Plugin Tutorial

This is an example ExternalPlugin to show 3rd-party developers how to create one. An ExternalPlugin is code that runs outside of the SourceCred runtime and generates a WeightedGraph and other important structures, which SourceCred instances can then integrate into their Cred scores via URL or file upload. This is optional. Providing a declaratio...

_20-Sep-21 03:32 PM_:

That's a good point; my thought would be to replace "their leadership" with something like "consistently hosting the X sessions and being available for questions afterwards". In my view, praise would be best if mapped to specific actions that are valued somewhat independent of performance?

If we say "her leadership of X" rather than just "her leadership", now we can assess the impact of X rather than how we feel about the person.

It's still subjective to a degree, but it's easier to discuss without it feeling personal. What do you think @liviade ?

And if the quant process becomes more asynchronous we would need to define those rules and guidelines more clearly anyway.

"their leadership" maybe can be classified as some sort of general appreciation and will receive less weight/score than "consistently hosting the X sessions and being available for questions afterwards".

Had a good talk with @hz today and gained some more insight into SourceCred plugins etc. Some takeaways: - Building a plugin does not seem too difficult using the ExternalPlugin tools - SourceCred already does something like 85% similar to praise using the included Discord bot and one channel configured for the purpose -

*props*

they call it. No manual quant though, number of reactions determine praise/props weight. - SC also is planning or at least have been planning to build a separate tool called

*The Creditor*

with the purpose of tracking contributions outside of what can be more easily measured - "care work", "planning that conference", etc. I'll check and find out how far they have come with the Creditor.

Another situation to imagine is that if Newcomers A and B show up and see "Praise (insert your favorite TE OG rockstar) for being great" and A decides to follow up with "Praise B for being great", we avoid the situation where we have to go into why Superstar X's greatness is worth more than Newcomer B's. I am primarily proposing we praise accomplishments, rather than individuals.

They don't have to be necessarily discrete -- you can say "Praise mz for his incredible work both as CEO of BlockScience and as the author of fundamental papers on cryptoeconomics."

When we drop the name "mz", it's still possible to recover the fact that these are nontrivial doings.

Yes, important, but what kind of contribution to the TEC right now is him being a CEO and writer of important papers? (edited)

It is not a "here and now" contribution but rather him adding his knowledge to our pool of knowledge, and possibly lending his weight adding to the credibility to the TEC. Which are good and praiseworthy things.

@kristofer hey! Sure. We can configure bot with some ID. Or give praise_giver role to Alexandra and configure praise bot to listen messages. If message author is bot -> check roles of this bot

There are multiple options

In new praise system backend we can create api endpoints for telegram and discord praises

So Alexandra will be able to send http request to this endpoint

For example POST to‚Ä¶ requestBody { Server, UserIds, Reason } Headers { Some secret token }

_21-Sep-21 06:33 AM_:

yes, that can be done. *However* looking at the direction discord's API is going.. eventually they're gonna make it such that a bot can only post something when mentioned or called via an interaction

Though, since we're building a backend API we could probably set up an endpoints for the same, as rdfbxx mentioned above^ (If we want the bot to also say announce who's getting praised, we can also have it post a message in the channel via a webhook)

I think gateway events like people joining voice calls would be trackable

They're probably putting restrictions on the message event(It's thrown off whenever someone sends a message...). Also, afaik they're not enforcing this for small bots, but I have a feeling that somewhere down the line they're gonna change how the API is structured (edited)

Ok, great! For a bot like Alexandra it is probably easier to extend it to post praise messages to Discord than to interact with our API. Good to know both options exist.

Interaction with the praise system by letting bots post praise messages provides a really easy way to integrate with praise.

_23-Sep-21 04:35 AM_:

hmm, but I guess either should be straightforward.. (*Idk what Alexandra is made in, however most programming languages do have implementations for making HTTP requests.) I think looking into making the API method might allow us to extend the backend to integrate with multiple platforms without any issues.... (edited)

_23-Sep-21 09:58 AM_:
The short term goal for the Reward System project is to make sure the TEC can do a praise quantification and rewards distribution close to the commons upgrade. Mid term goal is to develop Praise into a standalone open source system to be used by any community.

i see TEC is still writing all participants in meetings by hand in praise and just want to drop the meeting bot that we have at sourcecred that i believe could be adapted to automate that for you

Yeah, that could make total sense. If SC can deal with everything that can be "auto quantified" then the implementation of Praise would become a lot simpler and cleaner.

@kristofer and perhaps others - once we have a clear idea on the detailed process for the reward system what is the next step for advice process? I think we should pointedly get some validation from other relevant experts, token engineers, data scientists etc.. would be very helpful to catch any oversights and not repeat the mistakes of the old reward system.

Yes, definitely! The process description you and me produce together with the *Rules of Praise and Quantification* should provide enough material to do a good advice process. A summary post in the advise process section of the forum linking to both docs when those are done? And together with that schedule an open Q&A session?

When we communicate about the work being done here, let's emphasise that this is not about replacing the current process with a new one, not even about doing a major redesign. It is about refining the current process ‚Äì making it easier to administer and more transparent ‚Äì allowing the community to take part in deciding how we value different kind of contributions.

One thing to consider, maybe not for the MVP version but for coming versions, is how do we manage the user registry in the best way? We discussed bots for onboarding users, asking them about eth adressess etc. But, a user/member registry is a common need for the TEC as a whole, for more apps than praise. A central user registry would benefit all projects. MetaGame, BoardRoom (and SourceCred?) have begun tinkering with Ceramic/IDX, has someone had a look at what they offer? (edited)

I think 1Hive has close ties to the brightID project, maybe something in that direction? I think a good web3 DID system is definitely something to have on the plan for the future (but maybe for the MVP that would be a bit rushed)

Even though 1hive does have brightid as a verification mechanism, their central registry is built by the the ledger in the sourcecred bot, I think. The other thing that they use for keeping track of people is their wallet addresses, which I think they get from token-holder/platform snapshots or the brightid signup on a faucet, but that only contains data limited to - them being human, and them having a valid address.

I think it will be helpful to look into what from category 2 is automated, and what can enter a more subjective space. For ex - someone making a post in the forum can be quantified by sourcecred, but someone that replied quickly to a requested advice in the forum would be handled by praise.

Thanks! I've been poking around the resources already! For anyone who doesn't know, I'm LB and -while I'm not a coder- I have a lot of experience with the fundamentals of the SourceCred technology as well as a lot of ideas around what the User Experience of the product could look like. If I can support the implementation of reward systems that increase the experience of emotions like gratitude, connection, and celebration within community; I'd be happy to help!

_03-Oct-21 03:15 AM_:

Actually I feel there's a key DAO problem to address here, which is perhaps associated to rewards, but would love to see a solution ... When deciding to tag folk or not, it would to good to see if they are largely inactive, they might appreciate a tag, moderately active, they are managing their tag levels sufficiently, very busy, they would appreciate some restraint on tagging, or hyperactive, they would prefer not to be tagged if at all possible. (I'm not even going to get into the point about subject relevance, but could do if folk are interested) I'm mindful that wider rewards include things like community engagement, learning and knowledge, the ability to contribute plus others I've no doubt, as well as reward tokens.

Welcome to the weekly developer sync tomorrow at 16:00 CET!

<img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f485.png" width=50 height=50>

Room: The Community Hall. We are halfway into this second sprint and will use maybe half the meeting for a weekly standup. The remaining time I would like to focus on identifying issues for the different workstreams to put on the ZenHub board.

**Agenda**

What did you do the last few days? What will you do in the days ahead? Anything blocking your progress? Reward System process ‚Äì from here to first quant post Commons Upgrade @mitch (üçî, üçî) Rules of Praise and Quantification @liviade Praise backend @rdfbbx @Nuggan Praise frontend @Striker SourceCred bots and config @Vyvy-vi @mateodaza

@üêô octopus just shared this notebook where him and @ygg_anderson did most of the data cleaning and a lot of it can be repurposed [https://github.com/CommonsBuild/praiseanalysis/blob/main/cleaning-praise-data.ipynb](https://github.com/CommonsBuild/praiseanalysis/blob/main/cleaning-praise-data.ipynb) he said we don't need to stop sharing links and emojis in the praise but that we can build a "praise cleaner" that runs before the analysis. We just need someone with some pyton skills to build it

praiseanalysis/cleaning-praise-data.ipynb at main ¬∑ CommonsBuild/pr...

maybe @Nuggan could look into it?

so emojis would still be present in the quantification but wouldn't get in the way of the analysis cause the more simple the data the better

the more social question is: would a praise that has an emoji be more appealing to the quantifier than one that doesn't?

_07-Oct-21 12:17 PM_:

I think emojis have a spontaneous quality to them that will make our praise radically more subjective and arbitrary

typing out praise is easy but it takes some amount of thought, sprinkling emojis is almost an impulse

I like this idea -- people can include emojis if it fits their style, but then the quantifiers couldn't be influenced by them?.

Also, perhaps in the process there's a way for quantifiers to choose whether they see original names or silly pseudonyms like "aardvark"? (My original name is a silly pseudonym

_08-Oct-21 07:45 AM_:

It can easily be added later. But @mitch (üçî, üçî) made good argument yesterday about the random nature of those reactions. Community members will mostly likely not read through the whole list to +1 what they are touched by. Instead they will stumble over the praise feed more by accident and most likely only react to the first few items visible on the screen. Does that mean that the signal is useless, no. But it is definitely quite noisy. (my free interpretation of what mitch actually said)

This sounds wise. Emoji-reacts are accumulative toward total credit in sourcecred and this takes the place of a committee that goes over the "praise" in the spreadsheet. Not that we're using SC here in Discord but it's the whole basis for that product on this platform and it's good to keep in mind which tools we're attempting to serve which social / rewarding behaviors / outcomes. I also agree that emoji reacts will be indicative of value to the committee who qualifies praise so the question is: do you want input from the rest of the community on the committee outside of the writer of the praise? if so, super promote emoji-reacts on praise and if not, disable emoji reacts on praise so that it's not just random.

Being complete Python illiterate, this is what I envision: One sheet, three tabs: 1: Quantified praise data, columns for manual adjustments and comments 2: Grain data from SourceCred, similar columns for adjustments and comments 3: Smart sheet that runs the "distribution algorithm". We can write a script if needed. Are you saying that a sleek setup could be instead feeding tab 1 and 2 into a Jupyter notebook that calculates and explains the token distribution calculation?

@üêô octopus Then I guess in that notebook could also be some analysis and visualisations of both inputs and final distribution?

Looks great! a couple of points I think could change are - In step one on the sourcecred side inside the square: we don't want the discord plug in from sourcecred operating. Only the one that records calls. - In step 3 I don't think sourcecred data needs the human verification. We will have insights about how sourcecred params are working after the analysis. Or you think it would be nice to have it there so when people are looking at praise they could have a full picture of all the contributions? - The analysis should have 2 separate data sets, one from praise and one from sourcecred - correct me if i'm wrong @ygg_anderson

just to clarify - the committee and the quantifiers are different roles. So the quantifiers will be rotative community members who will offer a value to the praise written by someone else. I think the rotative and volunteering aspect of this role gives enough signal from the community with not much room for gamification. I like when the reactions to praises are spontaneous and not a form of capitalization

sounds good to make it configurable. I think it would be a great experiment to try anonymity tho. We could make one round anonymous, one round with names and compare the analysis after to see if there are meaningful differences

I have this idea for what happens with the data after being exported from praise and sourcecred. Not being a python/Jupyter wizard myself I'm asking you all to see if this is possible andor a good idea. The general idea is to manage the "second half" of the rewards system process all in one Jupyter notebook. That means: 1. Bring the quantified praise data and SC data into the notebook as CSV 2. Make manual adjustments with comments (there seems to be a plugin allowing editing of CSV data) 3. Calculate the token rewards in a nice looking sheet with explanations, formulas and visualisations. This is where the TEC distribution algorithm lives. 4. Additional analysis and statistics on separate sheet along with a short quantification text report by the Rewards DAO Committee. This whole package of notebook, data and edits would live on github and made accessible through [https://mybinder.org/](https://mybinder.org/). And important: each new quantification period a copy of the notebook is made and put in a fresh folder on the repository, allowing you to move back in time and check on older quantifications. @üêô octopus @ygg_anderson and other pyhton wizzardz, is this doable?

Yeah, let me try better. What is the token used for grain? And is there an approximate amount of tokens that are used for this conversion every month?

Proposed Change to Grain Redemption

As discussed in the SourceCred Finances Discourse post, SourceCred can no longer afford to support a fixed $1 redemption price for Grain, while continuing to issue Grain. This issue is that while we do have financial resources and funding (totalling to about $425k through end of year), we have around 1M Grain currently outstanding. Thus, mathema...

[hey @mitch (üçî, üçî) @kristofer @mateodaza we should figure out how much to ask for the reward system in the initial buy in proposal. It would be great to have some idea of how much funds we are willing to stream to rewards every month](about:blank#)

_17-Oct-21 09:38 AM_:

I outlined in the buy-in proposal draft that the reward system would seek funding for the first 6 months of rewards, I took a ball park number of 5-7.5k wxDAI distributed bi-weekly, giving us a range of 60k-90k wxDAI

in relative terms that is 24-36% of the buy-in amount we will be proposing (edited)

interesting, thanks for sharing! So if the base of grain redemption gets to $4k a month it means people are getting a decent income just with sourcecred.

I wonder if grain becomes a token, if we would still be able to distribute in TEC or if it would mean distros only happening in grain

in the last quantified period we had 726.167 IH If we just double this to consider an approximate 2 week period we have 1,452.334 IH Dividing 7.5k to this total IH we would have 5.16 wxDAI per IH.

so even if we double this amount to ~10 wxDAI, which still isn't great we end up with 15k per period... then for the 6 month period (12 quants) we arrive at 180k that's 72% of the buy-in request for TEC and 11.4% of hatch funds

I believe strongly that for the initial period of 6 months we should be conservative with the funds we allocate to the rewards system since there will be lots of learning and adjustments we'll need to make.. it would be a shame to misappropriate considerable amounts of hatch funds resulting from this "pilot" period

it would also be a different story if we raised 8 million from the hatch but unfortunately that wasn't the case

_19-Oct-21 12:43 PM_:

one further afterthought is that since we can acquire 6 months worth of TEC upfront we will benefit from any price increases of the token. We'll be holding a fix amount of TEC, but rewards are denominated in wxDAI, yet disbursed in TEC. so if at launch we have 90k wxDAI worth of TEC in the rewards system and the value of TEC doubles we'll have effectively 180k wxDAI worth of Rewards to use.

We will export data from Praise and SourceCred to calculate the final token distribution, make analysis and write a distribution report. How does this exported data look?

Token balance is something I didn't see, which is viewable from the sourcecred ledger/ explorer. Perhaps showing how many tokens someone has obtained historically as well as a current balance if that's desirable.

Thanks. We want to be paying the rewards with the TEC token. Do we setup SC to calculate the TEC token distribution for us or do we convert grain to TEC tokens manually in a spreadsheet afterwards?

If I'm not mistaken grain is the same thing as TEC. Code the word tec in place of grain and it ought to do all the math for you on the ledger, I would gather this is where you could pull the balance from. Our "grain" can be any token a community is using. (edited)

_03-Nov-21 07:27 AM_:

Hi all! The meeting tracker bot for SourceCred will most likely require meeting facilitator to start the tracking before each meeting. Is that a reasonable requirement? Starting the tracking means interacting with the bot, givining it a command like /attendance #üèìÔΩúcommunity-hall 60 minutes or similar.

Hi everyone, moving forward with the committee, I would like to nominate a few people for us to get this settled. **If you are being nominated please react with a thumbs up if you want to participate, and a thumbs down if you don't.** Being part of the committee is going to be a paid role and this are the responsibilities involved with it: - Manage funds from the initial buy-in proposal directed to the reward system. - Once the initial buy in funds are over; committee members will submit proposals to the DAO requesting funds. - Once funds are collected they will send wxDAI to the bonding curve and transfer the resulting TEC tokens to the Reward DAO - Set up Sourcecred parameters - Coordinate with comms to recruit quantifiers and add them to the dashboard - Create proposals in the Reward DAO with the data from the dashboard to distribute funds to contributors - Post an analysis report that will come pretty much ready from the dashboard. It's a substantial amount of work, so I suggest we have 7 people involved, who will be the only ones with voting power in the Rewards DAO

I suggest @mateodaza , @kristofer , @mitch (üçî, üçî) , @chuygarcia.eth , @Vyvy-vi , @ALOYSIOUS , @Nuggan , @liviade , @ryeder (they/them) @ygg_anderson (edited)

We managed to cover a lot of stuff on the dev sync today!

<img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f389.png" width=50 height=50>

Two super interesting new threads emerged with great rabbit hole / scope creep potential: 1. Once SC and Praise is running, onboarding a new member as a Rewards recipient means having to make up to seven different verifications of user accounts - Telegram, Discord x 2, Discourse, GitHub, Twitter, Ethereum. We have to investigate how to make this process smooth. Is some kind of decentralised centralised registry an option? - Action: Invite to separate idea session (Kristofer) - Action: Contact Metagame about myMeta (Kristofer) 2. What if praise can be used as a signal, as a data source to verify users? As Vyvy_vi describes it: "

*Praise being something that can be used as a proof of being an actual person that's value aligned?*

" By being praised, you build a trail over time, a really strong signal about your strengths and contributions. What do we use this signal for? All notes here:

- Action: Invite to separate idea session (Kristofer) - @kristofer The ShineDAO community has onboarding that walks a user through all the user identity input and wallet linking etc in order for an individual to connect to the community Tooling. perhaps something of this nature would be helpful for registering a users info for various bits of web3 tooling we wish to use.

Yeah, identity management will be a key component for the evolvement of DAOs. As important as any governance tool or augmented bonding curve for the long term. And it definitely feels like a potential part of the Commons Stack stack of components! Wonder who will crack the use case and become the "industry standard"?

No, we write our grants privately as of now and they aren't proposed they're just sent, lol. It's being written for a StacksGrant. We talk publicly about what we're up to in our dev meetings though.

[We managed to cover a lot of stuff on the dev sync today!  Two super interesting new threads emerged with great rabbit hole / scope creep potential: 1. Once SC and Praise is running, onboarding a new member as a Rewards recipient means having to make up to seven different verifications of user accounts - Telegram, Discord x 2, Discourse, GitHub, Twitter, Ethereum. We have to investigate how to make this process smooth. Is some kind of decentralised centralised registry an option? - Action: Invite to separate idea session (Kristofer) - Action: Contact Metagame about myMeta (Kristofer) 2. What if praise can be used as a signal, as a data source to verify users? As Vyvy_vi describes it: "*Praise being something that can be used as a proof of being an actual person that's value aligned?*" By being praised, you build a trail over time, a really strong signal about your strengths and contributions. What do we use this signal for? All notes here:](about:blank#)

[Hi everyone, moving forward with the committee, I would like to nominate a few people for us to get this settled. **If you are being nominated please react with a thumbs up if you want to participate, and a thumbs down if you don't.** Being part of the committee is going to be a paid role and this are the responsibilities involved with it: - Manage funds from the initial buy-in proposal directed to the reward system. - Once the initial buy in funds are over; committee members will submit proposals to the DAO requesting funds. - Once funds are collected they will send wxDAI to the bonding curve and transfer the resulting TEC tokens to the Reward DAO - Set up Sourcecred parameters - Coordinate with comms to recruit quantifiers and add them to the dashboard - Create proposals in the Reward DAO with the data from the dashboard to distribute funds to contributors - Post an analysis report that will come pretty much ready from the dashboard. It's a substantial amount of work, so I suggest we have 7 people involved, who will be the only ones with voting power in the Rewards DAO](about:blank#)

Would someone in our call recommend another avenue for grants for the sourcecred dev team? Right now we're focussing on Stacks but if there are suggestions of other avenues we can use those to get self-service identities and other items built

SourceCred requires community members to react to the posted messages for the grain calculation, right? We wanted to avoid that for meeting tracking. See attached pictures from SC Discord. One meeting got 4 reactions for 5 participants. The other has 9 reactions and 3 participants. Don't this risk leading to some meetings being valued more than others?

_11-Nov-21 03:36 PM_:

Yes, similar to what I hear about the praise system, meetings are valued differently and unlike praise are open to qualification to all members and not a select group. This reflects that all meetings are different but definitely changes d/t participation and individual tracking - not problems I see TEC having btw - but in short yes, all meetings are rewarded based on an instance of community valuation. This includes having roles (we've tossed around CredHistorians) of people (not unlike praise) who go back and retroactively add cred to undervalued posts (in this case meetings). If you are looking for a system that values every meeting and all participants present equally than this is not the correct tool *unless* you weigh the channel differently and set default posts to 1x and restrict emoji reacts. So there is a way to adapt the product to fit this need, of course I would want to test it.

Wednesday, 20:00 CET in the Community Hall We have a pair of hot topics related to the Rewards Committee this time so let's plan the meeting similarly as last week. We start with relatively short status updates and reserve the second half for Rewards Committee discussion.

**STATUS UPDATES**

What did you do the last few days? What will you do in the days ahead? Anything blocking your progress? - SourceCred bots @Vyvy-vi - Praise backend @rdfbbx - Praise frontend @kristofer @graial @hruday - Allocation, distribution and analysis @MS @Nuggan @üêô octopus - Identity management @kristofer

Ô∏è Hot topic #1: Rewards Committee? Reward Board? Shouldn't Rewards just be a full WG? A lot speaks for that. A WG becomes a part of the visible structure of the TEC. It will be seen in the weekly updates, it will have to do transparency reporting, it will have a Steward, etc. Let's talk about it.

Ô∏è Hot topic #2: We are approaching 6000 praise items since last quant. Either we make the first quant post upgrade a mega thing or we break up first quant into a few smaller chunks. The first chunk then could be like just 500 praise items and also serve as trial run. Anyone opposing this?

_17-Nov-21 11:58 AM_:

What did you do the last few days? - Created user epic for devops deployment (involves some tooling choices that) - further adjustments to the current feature branch in prep for a merge What will you do in the days ahead? - Review gaps in quant period page with krstopher - get the first pass at a staging app up (on heroku?) Anything blocking your progress? - it appears feasible to make a long duration jwt to facilitate testing of the front end. Does that sound like a good idea? (edited)

I need to go... but @liviade if we're going to be a working group then we'll be reporting in community hall, right? @kristofer would that be you? We can use that to recruit. But the workflow I see is documenting the quantifier role first.

When is the next quant?

Yes: @ praise giver is a role that can predicate receiving cred for meeting contributions (this is built in to the sourcecred product) Question: is this needed? does identities activation do this for us already? *I think we could still address this*

My experience: whether someone's identity is activated or not, their activity on discord is recorded by the bot. This is what I'm referring to. It feels cleaner to have this cred recognized only after receiving a weighted role, such as praise giver or new member or... ? whatever they choose. (edited)

_24-Nov-21 03:16 PM_:

Interesting! It is totally doable like you say. It would be up to the community / Reward Board to decide I guess. I'll phrase it like a question: If a complete stranger / newcomer joins a TEC call, should said person receive rewards for that or has the person to be a praise giver (or other discord role) to get rewards?

_25-Nov-21 06:34 AM_:

I'm thinking before we make the open call for Quantifiers we should confirm how we can manage them, I think a simple discord role would suffice. This would be helpful for tagging all quantifiers to complete time sensitive actions (like completing quants) and we could still keep it in the reward system channel so information remains consolidated. @Vyvy-vi can we make that magic happen?

_25-Nov-21 08:58 AM_:

yes it can be done, we have different options the obvious and most time consuming way would be to generate a tx that needs to be voted on for each individual send

in the case of an aragon DAO we can use an EVM script to batch them together into one proposal that needs to be voted on

(i think)

[I'm thinking before we make the open call for Quantifiers we should confirm how we can manage them, I think a simple discord role would suffice. This would be helpful for tagging all quantifiers to complete time sensitive actions (like completing quants) and we could still keep it in the reward system channel so information remains consolidated. @Vyvy-vi can we make that magic happen?](about:blank#)

sourcecred does that distribution automatically, we just have to figure out how to do it for praise. My hope was that the dashboard could automatically pair the final results from quants with their respective adresses in a cvs file that can be uploaded to the aragon dao, like we do with sourcecred

_25-Nov-21 11:27 AM_:

we made this dao thinking about the sourcecred distro and minted tokens just for the people who were in the meeting that time. It's easy to burn the tokens from the inactive folks now and mint new ones to the new people.

This are the params: it currently has 8 members and the vote duration is of 24h. Quorum is 41% - so at least 3 people have to vote on every round Support required is 81% - so 1 person can block a vote if up to 4 people are voting, and 2 people can block the vote in any scenario.

_25-Nov-21 02:54 PM_:

So, consider this work from Dr. Betty Martin. If we're talking about "rewards", we're on the left top part of this- we're taking an "action to benefit others". At least, we think this is benefitting others. However, reducing all service previously rendered to a flatland reward we eliminate a LOT of potential ways in which I might need to be rewarded.

I think we should consider such perspectives when creating our rewards system

The point here is not to create technical debt on TOP of cultural debt. We are inside the "cultural build" here, so we must consider that if we forget something technical created on top of a cultural assumption, a lack of care, or just through unintentional ignorance, then we might have to refactor tech to deal what we forgot to address. Both @Juankbell and myself have, despite looking at the Gravity work for some time, realized that we have cultural debt of our own, and broken or ignorant or denialist methods for dealing with things. "Technical debt (also known as tech debt or code debt) describes what results when development teams take actions to expedite the delivery of a piece of functionality or a project which later needs to be refactored. In other words, it‚Äôs the result of prioritizing speedy delivery over perfect code."

yeah, making the vote would be the last last step. at the time we thought of a short duration because we are talking about 2 week periods

once the distribution process starts it should have a momentum and a set pace, so people who are in the DAO will be prepared to vote in those dates and should be able to do that in 1 minute

the way we did last time is that both Mateo and I jumped in a call to make the proposal, so if he put something wrong by accident I was there to check too.

_26-Nov-21 02:13 PM_:

yeah

talking with Sem about this before, he was saying we don't even need to have a DAO for this. For sourcecred at least

but he recommended, in case something happens, we never know.

so the assumption is that everything will be great with all the processes we have in advance, and if a crazy bug happens, or a hack or something, we can stop the distribution by not voting on it

the thought spiral from research groups... A method I'm pondering in regards to praise or gratitude practices...a weekly rotation where each member gets a new person in the community to praise each week. How it could possibly be automated: A bot that holds profiles for each community member maybe this looks like a photo, their working projects, the projects/daos etc. Then you can find the person you're praising in working threads or server maybe? These thoughts are in response to the natural habit of preferences developing when people gather and how inequalities can emerge from these habits habits if not accounted for. Same people praising the same people....

_29-Nov-21 06:26 AM_:

Would this be a correct summary of the process? 1. Reward data from Praise and SourceCred is merged in the Analysis/Distribution dashboard. 2. The data is reviewed and changes can be made. This step is performed by the Reward Board members asynchronously or in a group call. 3. Someone from the board creates a DAO proposal for the distribution once review is finished. 4. Reward Board members vote on proposal to release funds.

ps. All steps above could in theory be performed during one post quantification reward board call.

I like the combination of async and sync processes. Have a review window of 5 days (Mon-Fri) and include a call somewhere in there to hash out any issues that can't be resolved async, at the end of those 5 days the quant review should be done and executed on the DAO

_30-Nov-21 03:43 PM_:

Going through the steps of an "ideal quant" in the analysis group we noticed that the way it is planned now, there are two groups of people involved in the process who have the chance to do direct modifications to the data: First the quants when they get together to review after the async phase, and then again the reward board when it reviews the proposal made by the quants. (edited)

<img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f44d.png" width=50 height=50>

2

Are we sure we want to keep it that way? While discussing, we thought that maybe it could be a good idea if the reward board only has the power to ratify the received quantification, or send it back to re-quantify if they find issues. It would add a level of transparency and "separation of powers" to the system.

It somehow defeats the point of the whole process of random/anonymous praise if at the end we have a stable group of people with direct access to modify the data...

(even if these modifications get recorded publicly!)

How does the community feel about this? Maybe we could take some time in the call tomorrow to discuss it?

Bringing awareness to the praisers as well, and not only to the praised. We can also see possible collusion scenarios

and map the relationships of community members

@kristofer maybe we skip to community call next since it's time sensitive and then cover whatever you think is priority after that? (edited)

I expanded a bit on Kristofer's document defining the responsibilities of the Reward Board in a bit more depth, clearly explaining the powers of the DAO and the off-chain responsibilities of the Reward Board, I borrowed and expanded on some of the points outlined in the WG manifesto. [https://www.notion.so/Reward-Board-Requirements-and-Guidelines-2766d6ca769f4c1daa6bca6e58860326](https://www.notion.so/Reward-Board-Requirements-and-Guidelines-2766d6ca769f4c1daa6bca6e58860326) Also during the process I had some questions, which I documented at the bottom, have a look and feel free to comment (edited)

Reward Board Requirements and Guidelines

The Reward Board is the group of indispensable long-term contributors that will make sure the Reward System remains fair, functioning and transparent

hey @kristofer I had some questions from the reward system dashboard you demo'd yesterday - What's the point in being able to name a quantification period? Shouldn't the title be the Quantification Period Dates - what's the point of calling it something other than that? How exactly does marking duplicate praise work? how does it work if we identify multiple (3+) instances of duplicate praise?

_02-Dec-21 10:58 AM_:
Period naming, similar to ZenHub/GitHub sprints. There is no reason not to allow for a name. Some community calls a period "June 2021", another wants to sync with sprint schedule and call it "Praise period #13". Duplicate praise counts as 0 when avg score is calculated, simple as that. It works even if you and me as quantifiers mark different combinations of a group of praise as duplicates. Does that make sense?

_02-Dec-21 11:10 AM_:

Okay so if I'm a quantifier and I wanted to make a mess of things what happens when this happens: Praise 1, 2 ,3 are duplicate Quantify Praise 1 - > give weight of 32 Mark Praise 2 -> duplicate of Praise 1 Mark Praise 3 -> duplicate of Praise 2 Mark Praise 1 -> duplicate of Praise 2 Would this be possible? would it throw an error?

_02-Dec-21 01:20 PM_:

Def would throw an error as that would create an endless duplication loop, a duplication vortex / black hole, which is not allowed. Thanks for highlighting this, we haven't exactly mapped out those rules yet. I imagine there are a number of edge cases and not really edge cases.

_08-Dec-21 09:57 AM_:

To be fair, we really only wanted it for the sake of having a system to assign rewards, and we enjoyed seeing the reward flows. But we didn't want to use the funtionality to pay the tokens on the system (we have our own system for that) -- Only half of our community actually signed up for it and did it, so the results were not terribly useful. This is fixable, if we kept doing it and trained people, but I always have a strong bias towards avoiding platform friction, and would like to find a discord native way to assign points to each other.

The Praise backend will make a pivot and move to new platform. The frontend will remain the same. We will start over with the backend development using the following tech stack: Node/Express/TypeScript/MongoDB The reasons are many: - Working with Java and Spring has made the project dependent on one person. That is not a good situation. We could find other Java developers but that takes time and we also have a community of developers alredy in the TEC, CS and General Magic. All those devs mostly prefer and know JS/TS/Python/Solidity. - I would like Praise to become as decentralised as possible in future versions. Making the switch from SQL to storing JSON docs in MongoDB will make that much easier. Many decentralised solutions - IPFS/Ceramic/Textile etc - offer the ability to store JSON documents but don't support anything looking like a relational database. - Building the backend and frontend using the same language will allow us to reuse code between layers - interfaces etc. - The final distribution can be made simpler and smaller with less dependencies and require less knowledge from a community that would like to use Praise. I wish I would have known and seen all this before we started but I didn't. That would have saved us a lot of time and effort. This is a realisation that has built up gradually and now seems like the right time to make a decision. @Nebs will be laying down the foundation for the new backend in the coming days. Then we will have some work to do catching up with the roadmap on the new platform. I expect us to be able to move forward quite quickly, the work that has been put into the Java backend has definitely not been in vain, we will be taking all insights to the new platform - data model, business logic/rules, etc. Will this affect the delivery date for the MVP version we need to do the trial quant? I don't know yet but hope to have a better sense of that within a week.

Thanks @griff (üíú, üíú) ! Yes we just completed our MVP of the Labs Platform, a tool that makes running cadCAD models in the cloud easy and we are looking for users who are interested in kicking the tires for us. You can DM me if you'd like to learn more.

[    Oyez, Oyez! A praise dev announcement!     The Praise backend will make a pivot and move to new platform. The frontend will remain the same. We will start over with the backend development using the following tech stack: Node/Express/TypeScript/MongoDB The reasons are many: - Working with Java and Spring has made the project dependent on one person. That is not a good situation. We could find other Java developers but that takes time and we also have a community of developers alredy in the TEC, CS and General Magic. All those devs mostly prefer and know JS/TS/Python/Solidity. - I would like Praise to become as decentralised as possible in future versions. Making the switch from SQL to storing JSON docs in MongoDB will make that much easier. Many decentralised solutions - IPFS/Ceramic/Textile etc - offer the ability to store JSON documents but don't support anything looking like a relational database. - Building the backend and frontend using the same language will allow us to reuse code between layers - interfaces etc. - The final distribution can be made simpler and smaller with less dependencies and require less knowledge from a community that would like to use Praise. I wish I would have known and seen all this before we started but I didn't. That would have saved us a lot of time and effort. This is a realisation that has built up gradually and now seems like the right time to make a decision. @Nebs will be laying down the foundation for the new backend in the coming days. Then we will have some work to do catching up with the roadmap on the new platform. I expect us to be able to move forward quite quickly, the work that has been put into the Java backend has definitely not been in vain, we will be taking all insights to the new platform - data model, business logic/rules, etc. Will this affect the delivery date for the MVP version we need to do the trial quant? I don't know yet but hope to have a better sense of that within a week.](about:blank#)

Hi all! Welcome to the last Rewards WG weekly sync of this year! We begin at 20:00 CET. The agenda is a little bit thinner today than usual, mostly because of the fact that many works streams now almost are done. The next big step is the trial quant. Let's revisit the roadmap and do some planning: - Trial quant date - SourceCred parameters work session - First quant analysis And, I'd like to propose we use the month of November as trial quant data month. This means we can start preparing both SC and praise data for quant whenever. You have discussion items? Add to the agenda doc:

Hi friends, hi @kristofer, I'm "back online" from a long health-related hiatus and I won't be able to return to Wednesday meetings! It's possible I could still check in, consult, or work to network between us and sourcecred and/or stacks advocates and our gov lab initiative with @hz, @Harold, and @Juliet ”æ LexyLab, but I can't go to regular meetings at our current time. Miss y'all, so proud of all your progress!! Congratulations on the Trial Quantification!

I added notes to the github issues - but here is a short summary: @Nuggan is almost closing the review of praise issue. @Juankbell praise was being captured, the issue was with the emojis in the bot. there was one praise from acidlazer that weren't captured, Nuggan will look more into it but it sounds like none of this problems will happen with the new bot @Vyvy-vi created @Zeptimus will host the call for quantifiers to give feedback tomorrow after the community call @mateodaza how is the progress with the sourcecred params? The action item from last call was to get more input from sourcecred folks to solve the questions, and have another meeting this week. Are we still meeting tomorrow? Is there anything we can help with? @kristofer do we have a date for the new test quant? the one we'll do internally?

Great stuff! And yes, all users have at one time been TEC Discord users. If they have left the guild, then I guess there is not much to do. Most of them are probably still around but have changed user names.

I think we should start sourcecred there as well. That last praise cycle marked the transition between the reward systems we are using, i don't think it makes sense to pick a random date for SC

Hey @kristofer @Adam Stallard@griff (üíú, üíú) I'll bring the BrightID convo here :) Brief context to everyone: what we are trying to achieve is to create a rep system for the TEC based on the reward system. People who participate in the reward system would receive an equivalent of a rep token in every distribution, and this rep token would be used to vote on Snapshot. Only folks who are BrightID verified would be able to receive both rewards and rep Problem we are attempting to solve: Create a sibyl resistance snapshot governance and bring back quadratic voting. The reward system would also be less gameable, specially on sourcecred side. Challenges to implement: Praise and Sourcecred data bases aren't shared, so technically people can give one address for praise and one for sourcecred. - How could we check that the addresses we have are from bright id users in an easy way?

hard to say tbh, seems like they're just starting and there are some things to figure out

but as far as they've described it, you get a reputation score from various reward systems within metacred and that already solves half of what you were saying on your first message (edited)

Great! What we would like to achieve is that we make a first grain distribution for the date July 25. And then one distribution every week from then until now. Another way to put it: Distributions are generated on Sundays with July 25 being the first. Is this possible?

Nice to be here. How do you register for Praise and Sourcecred? From my experience, I get praise by being in discord and sourcecred by being on github.

Hey @Adam Stallard, sorry was afk during the weekend. Yeah, praise works on Discord and Telegram. And our SC instance has been configured to track contributions on Discourse and GitHub. To activate for Praise: Interact with the praise bot /praise-activate (not launched yet), get redirected to the praise dashboard web where you sign a message using MetaMask. Discord and ETH linked. To activate for SC: Interact with the Discord pollen bot developed by 1hive. Link your eth that way (unsecure/not signed link) and post proofs to Discourse/GitHub to link those accounts to your Identity.

So, no interaction between SC and Praise when it comes to Identities and proofs. Long term dream would be a centralised decentralised Identity management solution both SC and Praise can tap into. Perhaps running on Ceramic

In the short term I think we would be super happy to achieve something like this: - Praise and SC exports data - We merge that data and calculate rewards - We end up with a list of eth addresses and amounts - Run that list through BrightId - Only distribute TEC tokens to BrightId verified users on that list - Mint a separate reputation token to those users as well - Use that rep token for quadratic voting @liviade @griff (üíú, üíú) would that cover our need in the short term?

@liviade was telling me that we could gate the registration for SC and praise using BrightID.

What happens if someone gives you praise or SC points (pollen in 1hive) and you're not activated?

Doesn't it make sense to move this step further down; i.e. only do the calculation on addresses that are BrightID verified--or are SC points and praise used for something else beside TEC tokens and the reputation token?

For SourceCred: Adding the ability to verify BrightId using the onboarding bot is in theory doable. It is not super easy though and it is unclear what the verification would be used for. If we want cred and grain to be calculated only for verified users that would require a significant change to the core SC codebase. For Praise: We want it to be possible to praise anyone, even people outside of the community. So, verifying praise receivers is not an option. Verifying the senders could be done. But then again, the purpose needs to be clear. If we just want to mint the TEC REP token for voting, the method I proposed will work well and be fairly simple.

Anyone can be praised. Praise is tied to the discord username pimarily. SourceCred tracks all contributions by all users and generate cred scores for all those users independent of any verifications, connected eth addresses etc.

_15-Mar-22 07:21 AM_:

The end result is the same in this case. The downside with filtering out verified users before calculating rewards is that if a user later verifies, information about retrospective rewards is not easily accessible.

I mentioned it as potentially the easiest path. Discord bots understand roles, and BrightID unique bot gives out the "verified" role. It's really easy to add to a server. Hundreds of servers are using it.

_15-Mar-22 11:41 AM_:

yeah, it's on snapshot. The reason why I don't think it's a good idea to add the gate to snapshot versus the reward system is because people have an incentive to verify with BrightID if their rewards depend on it. But no one likes to vote already, so adding an extra step there seems counter intuitive

also because we want the rep to be tied with the rewards score, which I think gives the message that if you are receiving both TEC and rep tokens is because you can engage in governance

If so we can create (or modify) a special frontend that allows users to register an eth address of their choosing with the TEC app in BrightID. This is done anonymously; no one--not even BrightID nodes see the link between Eth address and BrightID, but it then allows us to get a yes/no answer about whether an eth address used for TEC has BrightID verification.

_15-Mar-22 11:47 AM_:

yeah seems like it -- I think it would be nice to have them integrated with the bots that get your ETH address for both SC and Praise. But not in a way that limits people's activity with praise and SC

Adam Stallard

[If so we can create (or modify) a special frontend that allows users to register an eth address of their choosing with the TEC app in BrightID. This is done anonymously; no one--not even BrightID nodes see the link between Eth address and BrightID, but it then allows us to get a yes/no answer about whether an eth address used for TEC has BrightID verification.](about:blank#)

_15-Mar-22 11:48 AM_:
Basically

- Only distribute TEC tokens to BrightId verified users on that list

You would need to go to the web page to do this extra step in order to receive TEC tokens.

Just to make sure: there is no registration step that currently happens right here in the flow. We would be adding a new step here for users to do, right?

So probably creating a new custom TEC branded page to allow users to anonymously link their BrightID to a eth address they use for praise/SC in TEC.

[Hey @Adam Stallard, sorry was afk during the weekend. Yeah, praise works on Discord and Telegram. And our SC instance has been configured to track contributions on Discourse and GitHub. To activate for Praise: Interact with the praise bot /praise-activate (not launched yet), get redirected to the praise dashboard web where you sign a message using MetaMask. Discord and ETH linked. To activate for SC: Interact with the Discord pollen bot developed by 1hive. Link your eth that way (unsecure/not signed link) and post proofs to Discourse/GitHub to link those accounts to your Identity.](about:blank#)

Ok, then let's make the decision based on which is a better user flow. You're welcome to try out BrightID discord bot [https://github.com/ShenaniganDApp/brightid-discord-bot](https://github.com/ShenaniganDApp/brightid-discord-bot) to see that flow. You can get an idea of how the "linking" on a web page flow looks here [https://idchain.one/begin](https://idchain.one/begin) .

The first option "just works" with no additional help from the BrightID integration team. For the second option, we'd need to register TEC as an "app" in BrightID, but we're happy to do that.

_16-Mar-22 03:34 PM_:

so you're suggesting it would be integrated with the general onboarding to the TEC rather than the activation process of praise and SC?

_16-Mar-22 04:02 PM_:

you weren't in the call yet when we discussed this. but it sounds like the best solution is to have Bright ID as a layer on the top that is not directly integrated with the reward system. We would just have to remind people to use the same address for the BrightID verification and reward system activation

adding the verification link to the TEC general onboarding bot would be great (edited)

_16-Mar-22 04:55 PM_:

the only difference would be for new members. up until the hatch we had a process to know people were value aligned, but once the market opened that became harder to filter. So the rep would be a proof of alignment based on contributions

I think we should have a forum post about this @Vyvy-vi you're right. We were just investigating if it was even possible at first

Yeah, I've done that *sometimes* when I feel the praise is coming from a more personal moment between two people so that when the one praised reads it can link from who - but not always. I can def start doing that; I do feel it would add more depth to the praise, would probably make people grant it a higher value (edited)

@liviade @ygg_anderson would it be possible to derive a "Gratitude Index" from praise? or even sentiment analysis and "Happiness Index"? We're working on making the invisible visible in the Invisible Economy... and that made me think of the amount of gratitude we helped each other cultivate along the whole TEC journey: It's a very valueable stock would be good to see on a TEC dashboard

but actually it would be good to learn how working groups could get analysis of their praise data - for that I would definitely pay taxes!

we've started to experiment with #0mega - however, I think it is interesting to see also how much gratitude flows to participants also from other WGs and correlations maybe?

But I have to do some learning before I crash with ideas that might not hold

what is the way to get up to speed asynchronously?

Or can we invite someone to give an overview to WGs?

[the idea is that the rep tokens are equivalent to the rewards score people receive in every round. This rep token would give them access to governance on snapshot that can return to being quadratic. Having the rep token allow people to move their TEC tokens to a private wallet if they want and still be able to vote. Bright ID verification ensures that the wallets with rep tokens are connected to a single identity  (edited)](about:blank#)

_17-Mar-22 11:48 PM_:

I might be missing some pieces, but it seems that the reason for BrightID is to go along with quadratic voting in the snapshot strategy. This is for people with reputation tokens. They must choose one eth address to use for quadratic voting.

I think I remember hearing that reputation tokens are tracked in a database or spreadsheet--and we probably have a link between the eth address they registered with and a discord id right?

option 1: combine the BrightID snapshot strategy with the quadratic voting strategy.

option 2: check whether they linked a verified BrightID to discord unique bot (they will have the "verified" role), and if so add their address to a white list for the quadratic voting strategy (edited)

Hi everyone! The new praise bot will be a two part command. To interact with the praise bot you will type /praise. Then you add another command to send/give/dish the actual praise. Historically, we have been talking about "dishing" praise. It has a nice ring to it but for non english native speakers such as me, it is a bit unclear what "dish" actually means. "Sending" praise is clear and unambiguous but perhaps a bit.. formal? "Giving" praise. Also clear but less formal. I give you my praise. What will it be? Let's do a poll: 1Ô∏è‚É£ /praise dish 2Ô∏è‚É£ /praise send 3Ô∏è‚É£ /praise give --

yeah... at first i thought they just wanted to explore options around the different reward systems but seems like so far they are pretty much looking into Praise (edited)

someone mentioned Avado's praise system and it seems to work similarly, i don't know if it's this exact same praise?

I really liked your suggestion to create a page like this for the TEC [https://idchain.one/begin/](https://idchain.one/begin/)

I don't see us using the rep for anything else, but in case we need it could be nice to have everything separate from snapshot -- we had some challenges creating strategies for snapshot before

<img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f62c.png" width=50 height=50>

. it feels clean with the idchain page, and then crossing databases to see who is verified before minting the tokens in each round -- what do you think?

just got off the call, they referenced Avado's Praise system (which seems to be the old version?) as a simpler one and they are down to implement it one at first to get the ball rolling and maybe update later. The scope for their reward system is smaller so seems like it shouldn't be much of an issue. (edited)

not sure if its a proposal inverter since its being developed by one org instead of a joint collaboration. It could work though! Hopefully we're out in the world building reward systems for other DAOs before the PI is finished. I would love to see us negotiating contracts to build them piecemeal in other DAOs. (edited)

@kristofer @mattyjee on the topic about rolling over rewards for people that haven't put their address on the database, I'm not sure how it works on the technical side but at 1Hive SourceCred is always calculating cred even if you haven't onboarded and you get the bulk of your rewards once you fill the information

maybe that can be looked into and replicated?

though i believe they only store the cred data and it's only converted to HNY when you onboard, so if 1 cred = $1 when you made the contribution but 1 cred = $0.5 when you onboarded you'd be getting your rewards based on $0.5 per cred, not sure tho (edited)

I agree with the principle: if people haven't completed their account setup their rewards should be "set aside" for them to claim later (at least for a reasonably long period of time).

_23-Mar-22 04:31 PM_:

about this... i don't know what would be the preferred decision but rolling over the $ instead of the score would also require a tighter accountability so the rewards unclaimed can't ever leave the Rewards Board multisig

but then if what's rolled over are the scores there's the risk of someone accumulating a big score amount and taking up a big part of the rewards on the period they claim

about this i have an idea, let me give it a shot (bear with me while i try to explain lol). So you get a table after every period with the distributions, if an account doesn't have the address you put their information for that period on another table. Now on the next period when you export the table again that new table should have the information from the current period + the unclaimed table

and just repeat that process over again

i feel like that does the job and doesn't sound too complicated?

Random thought - Since we are looking to sort praise by week - signalling a new cycle of work shouldn't we make quants by 4 week cycles instead of per month?

we might actually cut a praise cycle in half depending where it lands in the month and quantifiers might praise twice something that would have otherwise been marked as a duplicate.

I dropped them in the miro board under the big header of **Marking Duplicate Praise Revision** [https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lyTkWjY=/](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lyTkWjY=/) I'm suggesting we invert the process of marking duplicates in that instead of marking a praise as duplicate of another we simply highlight a praise then mark all the duplicates at once of that "original" praise. Adding in a nice header and some checkboxes. We can remove the need to squint to find praise codes and typing them into a box - it can all be done with just a couple mouse clicks! lmk what you think. @liviade @Nuggan @kristofer @mattyjee @Nebs

Yes, I like it! I think we could do a similar flow for dismissing praise. The general functionality is: the ability to select on or more praise items and then perform an action that affects them all. Let's iterate on this one or two loops and flesh out the spec.

_28-Mar-22 04:14 AM_:

Hi, sorry if I am jumping in! I participated in 2 quants already and also assigned to the current quant. I thought that in order to enrich the learning process of quantifiers, theres have to be some kind of feedback. I know that there are quant tweaks, but it is not possible for every one to attend (as it is for me). If the line is not to go into mechanism design with incentive and such, and relay on the cultural community and social code, a viable thing will be an automated feedback, where a quantifier can review the results of quantifications of praises she reviewed, see the other quantifications done by other quantifier for the same praises. The access can be via the praise dashboard. Is there something like that on the road map? Another thing that can help, in cases where quantifiers got certain habits, like range of quants, and values of certain praises, is to use some clustering. A very cool mechanism that can do this is the Correlated Agreement mechanism, although it aims at certain incentive settings perhaps it could be altered to fit the current settings. (edited)

something like Quadratic Praise?

_30-Mar-22 04:03 PM_:

some thoughts for praise onboarding for quantifiers and praisers - suggest people attend a quant review call once before quantifying - quick guide on how to be more specific when praising. i.e avoid referring to big tasks like "all the work", separate different actions into different praises (don't praise one person for multiple things in the same command) try to be detailed about why you are showing gratitude to a particular task. - when quantifying - pay attention to what actions you value the most, share thoughts in the post quant sessions. - educate on duplicate praise - Tiers ‚Äî praises should be aligned with our MVV. how to identify when something is unrelated to the TEC? - Educate about dismissing praise (edited)

There isn't a command as of yet for becoming a quantifier. You could reach out to a praise admin and request them to make you a quantifier.

_12-Apr-22 11:59 AM_:

@mattyjee @kristofer @mitch (üçî, üçî) do you think it's possible to have a feature that we avoid assigning someone to quant twice in a row? We probably don't have enough quantifiers for this, but maybe there is some type of boundary we could add? This is the 6th period i've been drafted in a row and my motivation and stamina definitely changed and there is a chance this can affect the quality of the quants

Hello people of reward system and @Quantifiers, we are reaching out everyone who aren't activated on their praise account. If someone has extra time and wants to join efforts, this is the spreed sheet used for this, the tab is "**praise activation**" and inside, there is a word document with the message (you can adapt it to your tone) that needs to be sent. If you outreach anyone, **just add your name** to the list!

[@mattyjee @kristofer @mitch (üçî, üçî) do you think it's possible to have a feature that we avoid assigning someone to quant twice in a row? We probably don't have enough quantifiers for this, but maybe there is some type of boundary we could add? This is the 6th period i've been drafted in a row and my motivation and stamina definitely changed and there is a chance this can affect the quality of the quants](about:blank#)

_19-Apr-22 03:34 AM_:

Some thoughts on possible options to consider: 1Ô∏è‚É£ This pace of quant work catch-up is for a limited time, can it be spread out a bit more? 2Ô∏è‚É£ What are the benefits of the praise culture and activity? I get this generically, mostly, but what is true in this specific instance? Visible benefits night help bring more folk into the activity. Folk do get the point about reputation, but maybe less so that it is typically evaluated and awarded by others, not ourselves. Does no praise equal no reputation? How are praise givers rewarded? 3Ô∏è‚É£ Persuading other DAOs to take this path might require some adaptation. A limitation or set descriptions on the praise that can be offered might help other DAOs adopt the system.

Hi everyone. So I uploaded the praise quant call to YouTube but unfortunately due to some problems my computer had during the recording the audio for the second half of the call was practically lost. The good thing is that the first half of the call is fine and the video of the second half was also recorded properly just not the audio :/ sorry for that guys!

Hey everyone! Following @zhiwei 's great analysis post I've taken the liberty to propose a revision of the Rules of Praise article on the forum - [https://forum.tecommons.org/t/rules-of-praise-and-quantification/667](https://forum.tecommons.org/t/rules-of-praise-and-quantification/667) Based on what we've learnt from the past few months of heavy quantification I think we can start educating the community on how to dish praise better. Let's start with a great base article and then we can start directing eyes towards it and distill some key concepts that we can send to @Praise Givers Looking for some more input on this first draft: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ut_eAz8Z8AP1e-e27OhfdzSnqwvNHwi6dw_bmVU11NI/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ut_eAz8Z8AP1e-e27OhfdzSnqwvNHwi6dw_bmVU11NI/edit?usp=sharing) @liviade @Zeptimus @Nuggan @zhiwei @Gideonro @Maxwe11 @bear100 @PhilH @innov8tor3 - perhaps of interest to you

something really really great to have on the quant dashboard is a "flagging" option. maybe it's not so hard to do?

<img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f601.png" width=50 height=50>

There are some wrong praises that most people won't dismiss, it would be nice as a transparency feature to flag and add a note to them (edited)

Looked briefly at the @zhiwei analysis, but couldn't see how to comment and not edit ... I've been assigning praise to forum contributions, I think these matter, same as Twitter contributions. This is on the basis that Source Cred may not credit praise retrospectively, and awaiting Source Cred activation. Can you advise please?

_02-May-22 09:44 AM_:

I implemented a strike system for quantifier attendance, I have been keeping track of quantifiers who have not quantified or partially quantified and I believe we should set some process for repercussions. It's important to keep an active quantifier pool so that we can have reliable and complete quants. System is as follows: total no show = 1 not quantified but notified an admin = 0.5 partial completion (>5% and <95% completion) = 0.5 2 strikes = removal from pool with notice full quantification removes 1 strike If you didn't quantify then the strike carries forward (edited)

@mattyjee the new dashboard looks great and dismissing praise has been working perfect- my feedback: 1. marking duplicates using the new button isn't quite working.

thanks for the feedback! 1. The actual calculated value of the duplicates will be accurate, but the UX shows the slider at "0". I agree this is a bit weird / unclear UX. I'll make a ticket to improve that. 2. Interesting I will take a look at that. Thanks for the heads up! (edited)

Currently we are catching up praise periods 1-10 distributing once a week. Once we have worked through the backlog, token distributions will be in sync with the quant schedule - bi-weekly.

Hi. Just in case this comes up in your call today, here is a short description of what we want to experiment with for Sampo working group, and what I've mentioned to @mitch (üçî, üçî), @Vyvy-vi, and @liviade (her idea about using the channel, actually) : * Sampo team members do Praise in Sampo channel * Praise quantification happens normally * Sampo has a bit of supplementary funds in our budget. Once a month, we pull the channel-specific data into a spreadsheet (or some other mechanism) and allocate those funds based on Praise feedback to boost the effects of the Praise. * We run this as a test for 3 months to see if it actually works and come back to Rewards w/ our findings.

Hey all! We have a technical issue with the Praise system currently. A planned upgrade failed. I really need to get the server back up again, could someone take over facilitating the WG meeting? @liviade @Zeptimus @mitch (üçî, üçî) ? (edited)

Was thinking about the praise system today and I wondered what if every time someone does a praise they get prompted to do a quant? This way everyone gets to quant but it‚Äôs not a high energy burden and it‚Äôs an alternative to trying to attract people to a quant role. It could be good if everyone got involved and were knowledgeable about both sides of the rewards system as a TEC member (praise and quant side). Has this been suggested before? Does it seem feasible?

It is an interesting idea, thanks! Currently we don't want everyone to be a quantifier. Everyone as in for example really new community members. Before quantifying you should have some basic knowledge about the community and have been onboarded as a quantifier. We also want to identify duplicates - that is why one quantifier gets to quantify all praise for one receiver/period. Quantifying individual Praise separately would make duplicate identification harder. But I love the idea of all praise being quantified always, that the process of quantifying is fully decentralised and constantly ongoing.

Hi all, here below is what I came up with for the info text and banner about activating your SourceCred account. @chuygarcia.eth it is quite wordy, perhaps we should do a banner with a clean and short message and attach the text when posting? BANNER

- same praise giver, same praise verbatim and the same week = dismiss - same praise giver, same/similar praise verbatim and different weeks = quantify - different praise giver, same contribution praised and the same week = duplicate - different praise giver, same contribution praised and different week = quantify

I did some investiagting and I noticed on the 15th no praise was dished, and praise that was dished on the 14th was captured in the last round.. perhaps it is related?

oh and also the TOP 10 praise in the report is showing the praise as nan. Seems to be a pretty critical bug. ‚ÄºÔ∏è

_10-Jun-22 04:24 PM_:

Also! Braining some changes to the review and distribution timeline, using the upcoming period as an example what do you guys think of this timeline?

praise period is 11th of june to 25th of june (saturday to saturday - 2 weeks) quantification is open the 27th until 4th of july (monday to monday - 1 week) review happens on 5th or 6th (tuesday or wednesday) forum post up 7th (thursday) (should have 48hr "community review process") DAO vote goes up 11th (monday)(24hr vote duration) distribution happens on the 12th (tuesday)

the main things here are: - quantifiers have 7 days (5 weekdays) to quantify - we would have to change the review call from thursday to a tuesday or wednesday - praise periods last for 14 days, however the review and distribution process takes 15 days - would this cause us to become perpetually behind on distribution?

I can't say much for the trusted seed, that's all managed by the Commons Stack. when you're in the TEC discord and you type /praise what happens?

@Nuggan @zhiwei is there anyway to get the cross-period analysis going?

Hey

<img src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/72x72/1f44b.png" width=50 height=50>

, I have a question that I would love to discuss. So our reward system has been developing fastly in last couple of months with quantification periods, bot developments and more ! However, even though we have improved the system a lot, the reward system requires lots of manual labor. I am wondering how is the discussions regarding automization of that process going on ? ( I am not regular in wg so sorry if these are already being discussed) I believe our reward system may benefit a lot from Natural language processing models in making automized quantification. We have lots of quantifiers that can make labeling job to feed AI. What do you guys think ? @mitch (üçî, üçî) @kristofer @ygg_anderson

[Hey , I have a question that I would love to discuss. So our reward system has been developing fastly in last couple of months with quantification periods, bot developments and more ! However, even though we have improved the system a lot, the reward system requires lots of manual labor. I am wondering how is the discussions regarding automization of that process going on ? ( I am not regular in wg so sorry if these are already being discussed) I believe our reward system may benefit a lot from Natural language processing models in making automized quantification. We have lots of quantifiers that can make labeling job to feed AI. What do you guys think ? @mitch (üçî, üçî) @kristofer @ygg_anderson](about:blank#)

We discussed this a while ago, while it's cool it takes away the human element that is very crucial. Providing decentralized updates, creating ways for community engagement with quantifying roles..

Yes @Mert Ozd, we believe the praise items being quantified by humans being super important. - The praise feed provides a rich source of information about what goes on in the community. Quantifiers effectively get paid to learn more about the community. Knowing and appreciating what your peers do is an effective way to build community. - No current AI would be able to asses the importance of a contribution based on the words in the praise items alone. Added context is often needed - having read other praise, having read a forum post referring to the contribution in question etc.

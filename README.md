  > **The Token Engineering Commons (TEC) is an open source and collectively governed project that aims to create a token economy that will accelerate the responsible & ethical creation of public goods within the TE community.**
  > 
  > This token economy will be based off of [1Hive’s Gardens template](https://www.notion.so/Gardens-TL-DR-c56ca04a2d064ed8b219079af190d53b) and have a bonding curve that feeds into a [conviction voting DAO](https://1hive.org/#/).

  > Community stewards and contributors from around the world are working together on the foundations of the open source project based on a rewards system developed by the Commons Stack known as Praise. Through Telegram and Discord bots and bridges, community members dish Praise to each other to recognize work. The Praise is dished according to a Tier system developed by members:
  > Praise Tier system
  > Tier 1 — Concrete unpaid volunteer work for building the TE Commons smart contract system and culture around it that is needed to accomplish the roadmap — 100% “Power”
  > Tier 2 — Work that supports the Tier 1 actions like donations, TEC promotion, votes on proposals, etc — 25% “Power”
  > Tier 3 — Supporting work that helps the TE Community, indirectly helping to build the TE Commons. If a contribution is part of tier one or two but the contributor is being paid for it they’ll receive Tier 3 Praise — 5% “Power”

  > 
  > a) As individuals, to promote dialogue within the organization and manage conflicts addressed through ADR (Alternative Dispute Resolution),\

The purpose of this document is to guide you through the steps of the Hatch and what happens to liquidity that is deposited. There’s a couple key variables to be aware of in the Hatch, the numeric values of these variables will be chosen by the community (your economy, your choice) but the overarching principles are very important to understand.

  > **GOALS**:
  > - Prepare the forum to work as a main communication platform for Hatchers and Proposals.
  > - Track, engage, and connect Hatchers, Builders (a.k.a proposals), Communities, and Organizations pre- and post-Hatch
  > - Coordinate with COMS and LEGAL so any update, change or information related and relevant for Hatchers and proposals, are being transmitted. 
  > - Educate the Hatchers so they feel comfortable contributing to the TEC Hatch
  > - Educate the Proposals so they feel comfortable proposing to the TEC via the forum before the Hatch
  > - Make sure that the objectives, principles and intentions from the TEC are transmitted and clearly communicated.

To achieve this we will provide a toolkit for communities to create novel, cause-focused economies that we call Commons. 
    >
    > To build a successful Commons, or any other socio-economic system, a community must consider both the technical and cultural requirements. The Commons Stack mission is to make it easy for cause-focused communities to meet and excel at these requirements so that they can launch a healthy Commons.

### Bonding Curves

* [Crowdfunding the Commons – Abbey Titcomb](https://blog.usejournal.com/crowdfunding-the-commons-d590238d8c3c) - Last week at ETHDenver, we built a proof-of-concept interface for launching curve bonded crowdfunding campaigns for social impact causes and organizations.
  > 🌱 Curve-bonded crowdfunding\
  > [...]\
  > Our project at ETHDenver was based upon a augmented bonding curve designed by Michael Zargham at BlockScience. The curve models a Token Pool (a Reserve of bonded DAI and a Supply of tokens) and a Funding Pool (floating supply of DAI available for use) that work together to create a self-sustaining and governing system for funding “labor” within a commons — aka any socially beneficial behavior which has positive impact on the commons as a shared resource. This “labor” could be defined as anything from trail maintenance in a National Park to contributing code to a free and open-source software project. We’ll be diving into Zargham’s design in a secondary article (coming soon!), and focusing on the key principles of the design here.

  > This article is a deeper technical primer into the system design of the Augmented Bonding Curve used for the Commons Stack based off of Michael Zargham’s complex system research at BlockScience. For brevity, this article will assume a preliminary knowledge of bonding curves (if you need a refresh or an introduction, check out Slava Balasanov’s deep dive into bonding curves, Jeff Emmett’s simple introduction, and our first article on the topic here). The beginning of the article focuses on the overall design of the system and the second half will dive deeper into the equations and simulations that define how it all works.

### Token Engineering Community

The TECommons is an outgrowth of the Token Engineering Community, which came out of the Commons Stack.

* [Welcome to the Token Engineering community!](https://tokenengineeringcommunity.github.io/website/docs/getting-started-welcome/)
  > **So what is "token engineering?"**\
  > Token engineering is a crossdisciplinary field that draws from established practices in systems, electrical, robotics & controls engineering, and more. It also draws from fields as diverse as Behavioural & Ecological Economics, Operations Research, AI & Optimization, as explored by Shermin Voshmgir & Michael Zargham in this paper on the Foundations of Cryptoeconomic Systems. It is a methodology that goes all the way from ideation to design, modeling, simulation, testing, deployment, and maintentance. It's the process of building cryptoeconomic systems that work, and keep working. Just like other public infrastructure like bridges and power grids, our future economic systems also need to be rigorously designed to be reliable under widely varying conditions. The goal of token engineering is to design and create tokeneconomic systems that are robust against exploits, unintended consequences and cascade failures, in order to protect and empower users.

  > Community stewards and contributors from around the world are working together on the foundations of the open source project based on a rewards system developed by the Commons Stack known as Praise. Through Telegram and Discord bots and bridges, community members dish Praise to each other to recognize work. The Praise is dished according to a Tier system developed by members:
  > Praise Tier system
  > Tier 1 — Concrete unpaid volunteer work for building the TE Commons smart contract system and culture around it that is needed to accomplish the roadmap — 100% “Power”
  > Tier 2 — Work that supports the Tier 1 actions like donations, TEC promotion, votes on proposals, etc — 25% “Power”
  > Tier 3 — Supporting work that helps the TE Community, indirectly helping to build the TE Commons. If a contribution is part of tier one or two but the contributor is being paid for it they’ll receive Tier 3 Praise — 5% “Power”

  > For the audit to be successful, the working groups will prepare the documentation needed to fulfill the audit criteria/checklist. The documentation will be gathered and saved in each WG section in the TEC Forum. The WG’s completed audit checklist form and their corresponding documentation will be reviewed regularly (frequency will be identified after trial audit) by the Transparency WG, but each WG may request an audit if they want to improve their transparency in between the reviews. The Transparency WG will make a note in the WG’s Forum section when the WG was audited.
* [Hatch TL;DR for potential hatchers](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ji2vV5c_PCXt2q0G-1wTddyOaUp5ESKWht2UKcoE7S0/edit?pli=1)
  > The Hatch is the critical initial phase of the Token Engineering Commons (TEC). The purpose of this document is to guide you through the steps of the Hatch and what happens to liquidity that is deposited. There’s a couple key variables to be aware of in the Hatch, the numeric values of these variables will be chosen by the community (your economy, your choice) but the overarching principles are very important to understand.

  > **GOALS**:
  > - Prepare the forum to work as a main communication platform for Hatchers and Proposals.
  > - Track, engage, and connect Hatchers, Builders (a.k.a proposals), Communities, and Organizations pre- and post-Hatch
  > - Coordinate with COMS and LEGAL so any update, change or information related and relevant for Hatchers and proposals, are being transmitted. 
  > - Educate the Hatchers so they feel comfortable contributing to the TEC Hatch
  > - Educate the Proposals so they feel comfortable proposing to the TEC via the forum before the Hatch
  > - Make sure that the objectives, principles and intentions from the TEC are transmitted and clearly communicated.
* [How to Become a Hatcher](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tsEPNb-gLEh9FKOGLBPt0prfWrOwjmnnjtPdCpy8lxo/edit)
  > A Hatcher is a founding member of the TEC DAO. As a hatcher, you will be a key member of our community who will have governance rights in the newly launched TEC DAO. It is you, the Hatchers, that will decide on the parameters  by which the DAO will be created - Your Economy, Your Choice!
* [TECommons/coordination] • [#418](https://github.com/TECommons/coordination/issues/418) • [#419](https://github.com/TECommons/coordination/issues/419)
* [Hatcher Outreach FAQ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16UI-EfD4qcwBaAv3Eexlv01SOK7oiDt4gkVT5rEY6X4/edit#) (Updated)
  * What are the implications of becoming a Hatcher?
    > By becoming a Hatcher you will play a significant role in shaping the economy of the Token Engineering Commons. In order to launch the commons, Hatchers will need to make key decisions regarding the parameters of the Hatch DAO and how the Commons Upgrade will occur. Hatchers will provide funding for the initialization of the Augmented Bonding Curve and will have significant influence on the direction of the TEC once the Hatch process is over.  
  * What is required for me to participate in the Hatch process?
    > The only requirements for you to participate in the Hatch process is to join the Trusted Seed and have a CSTK Score. In order to join the Trusted Seed, you must apply and once accepted you can become a legal member via the Swiss Membership DApp. Even if you already have CSTK tokens, you may not we encourage you to join the Trusted Seed to obtain a CSTK Score. Only legal members of the Swiss association have a CSTK Score and can participate in the TEC Hatch.
* [Hatcher FAQ](https://suits-nathan.gitbook.io/hatcher-faq/) - On GitBook
  * [Trusted Seed Membership](https://suits-nathan.gitbook.io/hatcher-faq/trusted-seed-membership)
    * Why do I need to become a member of the Trusted Seed to participate in the Hatch?
      > The Token Engineering community has voted to have Commons Stack Trusted Seed members to become the Hatchers for the Token Engineering Commons.  The reason for this is that it ensures all participants who are contributing to the Hatch are aligned with the mission and values of the TE community and who seek to create public value rather than individual profit. 
    * How much are the annual membership dues, and what if I can’t afford to pay it?
      > The annual membership dues are 450 DAI (minimum), and [scholarships are available](https://beta.giveth.io/campaigns/5feb2ca1dae3134bd0166dd6) to anyone in the TEC community that asks for one. Whether scholarships will be available in future years has not yet been decided though it will not be required to maintain membership in the Trusted Seed or to participate in the TEC. It is only required to participate in its initialization.

## Token Engineering Community

The TECommons is an outgrowth of the Token Engineering Community, which came out of the Commons Stack.

* [Welcome to the Token Engineering community!](https://tokenengineeringcommunity.github.io/website/docs/getting-started-welcome/)
  > **So what is "token engineering?"**\
  > Token engineering is a crossdisciplinary field that draws from established practices in systems, electrical, robotics & controls engineering, and more. It also draws from fields as diverse as Behavioural & Ecological Economics, Operations Research, AI & Optimization, as explored by Shermin Voshmgir & Michael Zargham in this paper on the Foundations of Cryptoeconomic Systems. It is a methodology that goes all the way from ideation to design, modeling, simulation, testing, deployment, and maintentance. It's the process of building cryptoeconomic systems that work, and keep working. Just like other public infrastructure like bridges and power grids, our future economic systems also need to be rigorously designed to be reliable under widely varying conditions. The goal of token engineering is to design and create tokeneconomic systems that are robust against exploits, unintended consequences and cascade failures, in order to protect and empower users.

### Bonding Curves

* [Crowdfunding the Commons – Abbey Titcomb](https://blog.usejournal.com/crowdfunding-the-commons-d590238d8c3c) - Last week at ETHDenver, we built a proof-of-concept interface for launching curve bonded crowdfunding campaigns for social impact causes and organizations.
  > 🌱 Curve-bonded crowdfunding\
  > [...]\
  > Our project at ETHDenver was based upon a augmented bonding curve designed by Michael Zargham at BlockScience. The curve models a Token Pool (a Reserve of bonded DAI and a Supply of tokens) and a Funding Pool (floating supply of DAI available for use) that work together to create a self-sustaining and governing system for funding “labor” within a commons — aka any socially beneficial behavior which has positive impact on the commons as a shared resource. This “labor” could be defined as anything from trail maintenance in a National Park to contributing code to a free and open-source software project. We’ll be diving into Zargham’s design in a secondary article (coming soon!), and focusing on the key principles of the design here.
* [Rewriting the Story of Human Collaboration (Or, an Introduction to Token Bonding & Curation Markets)](https://blog.goodaudience.com/rewriting-the-story-of-human-collaboration-c33a8a4cd5b8)
  > Token bonding curves, acting as automatic market makers, provide a useful alternative to the ICO as a token generation model.
  > 
  > So how does this work in the real world? Here is an early stage, relatively simple example, where we’ll conveniently leave out many of the problems that complicate the use of bonding curves, TCRs and curation markets — more on those later.
* [Deep Dive: Augmented Bonding Curves – Abbey Titcomb](https://medium.com/commonsstack/deep-dive-augmented-bonding-curves-b5ca4fad4436)
  > This article is a deeper technical primer into the system design of the Augmented Bonding Curve used for the Commons Stack based off of Michael Zargham’s complex system research at BlockScience. For brevity, this article will assume a preliminary knowledge of bonding curves (if you need a refresh or an introduction, check out Slava Balasanov’s deep dive into bonding curves, Jeff Emmett’s simple introduction, and our first article on the topic here). The beginning of the article focuses on the overall design of the system and the second half will dive deeper into the equations and simulations that define how it all works.

[Giveth](https://giveth.io/) - The Future of Giving • [Projects](https://giveth.io/projects)

* [About](https://giveth.io/about)
  > Our mission is to connect people, ideas, and resources to facilitate and incentivize social impact. We are not content with the current non-profit industry, and we are committed to developing a better, decentralized alternative. Solidarity not charity.
  > 
  > Our Vision
  > 
  > To build the future of giving, starting with a free, open-source platform connecting donors and mutual aid projects.
  > 
  > As a mutual aid project, you can post details about my project, raise funding, and post project updates.
  > 
  > As a donor, you can easily donate to specific projects as well as categories of causes.
* [Governance](https://wiki.giveth.io/governance/)
  > Giveth aims to be a breeding ground for governance experiments and make these accessible to the outside world through the use of blockchain technology. With the Giveth DAC we are experimenting and documenting anything that could be useful for future decentralized communities like ours (through concepts like Holacracy, RewardDAO, Liquid Pledging and more). At the same time, when we run into problems with our projects, we look outwards and unite people through initiatives such as scaling, signaling, block explorers and the decentralization of everything!
* [A Galaxy of Initiatives to drive Blockchain for Good](https://galaxy.giveth.io/)
  > Welcome to Giveth. We are a community focused on making the world a better place through the use of blockchain technology. Our flagship product, the Giveth Donation Application (DApp) will be an integral part of the Commons Stack project, and is striving to bring new governance models into the nonprofit space. We created the Giveth Galaxy to foster a larger network of organizations that will help us Build the Future of Giving we envision.
  > 
  > Right now most of our efforts are focused on building the Commons Stack, which will allow us to realign incentives for any public good by creating microeconomies around causes you support. We are the Giveth Decentralized Altruistic Community (Giveth DAC), and we hope YOU will join us.
  * [Giveth Social Coding Circle](https://wiki.giveth.io/social-coding/)
    > Welcome to the living and breathing core of Giveth, where we cultivate learning and support innovative projects, with a focus on blockchain for (social) good. We created a safe space for altruistic developers to talk about their passion projects, and help them recruit or find help and guidance from peers. We have served as an incubator for many of the projects in our Galaxy (DAppNode, BrightID, TennaGraph, our Blockternship Hackathon ...) and this is only the beginning.
    * [What is Social Coding?](https://medium.com/giveth/what-is-social-coding-fa81feacfa32) by Quazia.
      > Giveth has 4 main circles. The Communication, Governance, and DApp circle are all relatively self explanatory. The fourth circle is social_coding.
      >
      > The philosophy of social_coding is this: the best way to develop tools for building a DAC is to build a community of altruistic developers. The best way to build a community of altruistic developers is to give them a space where they can play, and try and get they to build whatever they want. Over time the tools should sort themselves out.

### Commons Stack on Giveth

* [The Commons Stack: Scaling the Commons to Re-Prioritize People and the Planet](https://medium.com/giveth/the-commons-stack-scaling-the-commons-to-re-prioritize-people-and-the-planet-fdc076aec4eb) - Kris Decoodt 
  > It’s first good to establish: why are the commons important? We have some really big issues on the horizon that we can only solve together: climate change, resource depletion, open source incentivization — these are all public goods that are prone to the free-rider problem. This problem applies just as much to the extraction of environmental resources as well as the funding of writing open code. It’s a coordination problem that underlies some of the biggest problems we face. Ostrom and others have suggested that we need larger-scale coordination mechanisms for making rules to determine how we use and allocate existing resources. We have some of these coordination tools already, but our current approaches are flawed. Our current global coordination mechanisms — both markets and states — are dealing with quite some challenges. We have one-dimensional economies that optimize for profit and exclude people and the environment from their calculations.
* [How Blockchain Economies align incentives around the Commons](https://medium.com/giveth/blockchain-economies-and-the-commons-cdb67dd1a163) 
  > There are a lot of ways to measure the progress of the blockchain space, and by many metrics, the space is barreling forward at an incredible speed.
  > 
  > But we at Giveth have noticed something: during the early days of blockchain, the focus was on creating new economies. Then, at some point, the emphasis shifted to creating new money. With the end of the ICO boom, we saw an ebb in the number of new cryptocurrencies being launched, but the space’s attention never fully swung back to the task of building self-sustaining economies. If anything, we’ve settled on something in between the two — trying to build autonomous organizations — in place of our original ambition. As our co-founder Griff Green has said, “it’s like the blockchain revolution just stopped.” What will it take to reboot this revolution, and to extend it from the digital realm into the real world?
* [Meet the Humans Behind the Commons Stack!](https://medium.com/giveth/meet-the-humans-behind-the-commons-stack-197af81fda93)
  > The Commons Stack core team is made up of token engineers and decentralized governance specialists who believe we can use software to help us establish quasi-circular economies that support important causes.
  > 
  > But we can’t — and won’t — do this complex and groundbreaking work alone. A select group of extremely qualified advisors has graciously agreed to support us through the multiple iterations of this development process. We expect that their guidance and their extensive collective wisdom will be indispensable as we work to design the very best commons management tools that we possibly can.
* [Giveth – Commons Stack Campaign](https://beta.giveth.io/dacs/5cffd214f0fcb951b8e2bc87)
  > The Commons Stack is an open source development project, building tools to provide sustainable funding and management infrastructure for community-driven economies. It will address the difficulties faced by shared community initiatives that currently rely on insufficient donations, grants, and pro-bono contributions, and allow them to bootstrap themselves using bleeding edge blockchain technology without forgoing their current funding streams.
